                            <p>Our story starts a long time ago, I wasn’t even born, in a small Italian village in Abruzzo, where my grandparents, in the photographs, and their parents before them, were making their wine from a small, hillyvineyards.</p>
                            <p>At that time cars were for rich people and they were not, they would get up at 3am in the morning, and with a donkey carrying all the tools, they will walk for about 10km until 12, when the sun had become too strong and they would walk another 10 km, Almost every day, every year.</p>

                            <p>This is where my and our story started. Then I came along and along came the tractors and the donkey went into retirement but still almost every morning, for a few more years, the same commitment and the same pride went into making their wine.  </p>
                            <p>When you are lucky enough to come from a family like mine, wine and food cannot be considered commodities, for us they are they are one of life’s pleasures. Everything we import is made with care and love, with passion, from real people, with faces, some of them are above, and stories like my grandparents. </p>
