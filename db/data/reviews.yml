  description: We have experienced this superb wine over a period of several years as our family in Arsoli (Lazio) have always purchased their wine from Jasci & Marchesani.  In September (2008) we drove to Vasto and bought several bottles of wine from Nicola.  It is one of the best wines we have tasted!  It is soft and velety - the taste is buonissimo!  We had the 2006 and 2007 vintages and both were excellent.  This is a very special and flavoursome wine.

  description: This medium Rose is best enjoyed in the setting which it was created, serve chilled on a barmy summer's evening, as the perfect accompaniment to seafood and pasta. This wine is full of subtle tastes and delicate aromas, in contrast with the Sardinian dichotomy of the sea and mountains. It is difficult to pick the individual fruits, such is the depth of the spectrum of tastes you will encounter.

  description: "Valpolicella Classico has aromas of tar and spices with underlying hints of vanilla and chocolate. On the palate, this Amarome is full, big, elegant and rich, is powerfull, a wine of extraordinary concentration and complexity "

  description: "The three wines in this pack are all excellent examples of the wines available in this region. The attractively boxed set makes an ideal gift for any lover of fine wines or as an accompaniment to any Italian banquet. I was personally delighted with the product and will be ordering more soon.

  description: |
    2004 is a much heralded vintage of Barolo, which has been receiving rave reviews.  Normally best at at least 10 years old, you should hang on to this wine, but by all accounts it's certainly worth buying and forgetting about for a while.

  description: Read about this in a review in The Times by Rob Tyrer. This prosecco is truly remarkable - not the cloying rubbish that's often passed off as prosecco (and yet sells by the barrel) but is nowt more than fizzy bad wine. It's light and refreshing and slips down very easily indeed, but not before dancing off the back of the palate. Already planning to order more of this little wonder. For a tenner it's very hard to beat (bought two cases on the strength of Rob's review - and ever so glad I did!)

  name: Borolo to rival Bordeaux

  description: If tradittionally Bordeaux has complexity and balance of tannins and acids in abundance then this Borolo would fare well with many Bordeaux even from the right bank. Yes there are berrys on the palate but the dry drench on the is not dissimilar to cherry and Kirch leaving one yearning for yet another mouthfull of a quite exquisite wine yet not from the right bank of Bordeaux but the foot of the mountain (piedmont). Quite simply delightful looking forward to the next bottle already

  description: "This is a wonderful rose.  Medium-bodied without being sweet, fresh without being too acidic, it is perfect served well-chilled on a warm summer afternoon in the garden.  Best to let it stand for a day or two before putting it into the fridge, as there is some sediment, which, although it does not detract from the taste of the wine, can make it appear a little cloudy.

  description: A clear winner, light fruity and pleasing, clean and crisp and refreshing on a hot summers day (if you can remeber one). Seems to be a winner particularly with the female of the species, as despite an array of quality Burgundy at recent dinner parties this was the wine that the majority of the ladies preferred.Summer drinking at its best (if we only had a summer to go with it)

  description: We have been to an excellent wine tasting evening and this was the dessert wine.  It was the nicest wine we have both tasted and ordered a bottle immediately and intend to buy on a regular basis.  Although dearer than our regular wine, we both think it is definately worth the money.

  description: Elegance and complexity with or without food this wine has it all in abundance. It went particularly well with a sea food and scallops starter and was equally at home with a much more earthy chicken and mushroom dish. A wine with Burgundian qualities which was also extremely enjoyable on its own. i am sure i will be back for more

  description: "I only have 1 bottle remaining of the six bottles i purchased just over 6 weeks ago. The bouquet is rich and redolent: dark fruits, with a pepper component also. Big, coating mouth feel almost chocalaty, dark fruits, cherry. Seemed to have a liitle effervescence which only added to a very pleasant drinking experience"
