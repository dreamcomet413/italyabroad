  description: This <b>barolo</b>, made with Nebbiolo grapes from old vines of a single vineyard, called Fontanazza, and a very low yield in the heart of the Barolo area, in La Morra, is another great expression of the terroir and the ability of Giacomo Marengo in making fantastic wines. Produced only in thousand bottles per year, these are sold well before being bottled. This 2001 vintage, a very good vintage for <b>barolo</b>, is elegant and classy, with an intense garnet colour and perfumes of raspberry, dried flowers and berries. On the palate, is full, rich, complex and well balanced with silky tannins and a long caressing finish. This Barolo has won several national and international awards including the Bronze medal at the International wine challenge.

  description: "This <b>Vin Santo Riserva</b> is made only with the best grapes, left over riping on the vines and then dried for three months in boxes before they are turned into wine and aged in barriques for more than 10 years. The result is a dessert wine with a golden colour, rich, generous and with a nose with aromas of honey, walnuts and dried fruit amongst others. Well structured, smooth and velvety, pleasantly sweet and with a long ending. The <b>Vin Santo</b> is probably the most known Italian dessert wines and La Casaccia's is a superb example. "

    This is an example of a well made cabernet franc from vineyards located in Friuli. Cabernet Franc is often used in blends but rarely on its own. This wine, that can be drunk young, with its bursting herby aromas, or laid in the cellar, for a more mature and complex wine,  in the mouth is smooth, with soft tannins and the caractheristic herby flavours and the bittery aftertaste.

    Why not join us for our first wine tasting evening in Seaham. A selection of Italian wines made by small producers will be paired to a fantastic food prepared by the chefs at Classico. The dinner will feature unknown Italian wines and tell how to taste wines and what to look for. Each wine will then be introduced by a talking about its origin and characteristics. Our events are also a great way to make new friends who share your love for wine.

    Made only with hand picked Garganega grapes from vineyards surrounding the town of Soave, near Verona, the Soave is one of the most famous Italian wines and Dal Cero is one of the coming producers. The Soave has become a bland, tasteless, cheap wine, however, when made properly it could be a fantastic wine. This is one of the best, with a rich nose with aromas of white fruits. In the mouth is refreshing, vibrant, textured and with the characteristic final hints of almonds

  description: "A mixed case containing a selection of typical Trentino wines. The wines, unique in their style and very different from all other Italian wines, are all made by the Egger Ramer family, and include 2 bottles each of:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Pinot bianco</b>\r\n\
    A clean and elegant pinot bianco, medium bodied with a nose bursting of apples and peaches. Crispy, refreshing and with a lingering finish\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Gew&uuml;rztraminer</b> \r\n\
    An outstanding, wonderfully round and balanced Gewurztraminer. Minerally and elegant on the nose with aromas of roses with cinnamon and nutmeg\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Lagrein</b> \r\n\
    This Lagrein is an excellent interpretation of the grape with a deep ruby colour with a nose of violets and plums with sandalwood scents\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Lagrein rose&rsquo;</b>\r\n\
    A fresh, medium bodied, fruity rose' wine made with lagrein grapes with a vibrant acidity and an enduring aftertaste with an elegant bitter twist\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Muller Thurgau</b>\r\n\
    A lightly aromatic white wine, this muller thurgau is crispy and fresh, bursting with white fruit and floral aromas, vibrant and full in the mouth\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Santa maddalena</b>\r\n\
    A red wine made with the native Schiava grape with a nose of red fruits, easy to drink, round and fresh. Sweet tannins and a lingering finish with a almond twist complete the wine \r\n"

This panforte, like all other Tuscan specialties baked by the Antica Pasticceria Betti, is handmade and uses the finest almonds, dried apricots, nectarines, peaches, and dates with no artificial additives. Enjoy it thinly sliced at the end of the meal or as a long-lasting, nutritious energy bar.

Its spicy, intense and persistent nose and the bittersweet taste make it a fantastic wine. Not just a meditation wine, the Barolo Chinato is a fantastic companion with chocolate desserts.

    Have you ever dreamt of becoming a wine buyer, travelling the world searching for the finest wines, leaving the city life behind? We wants to give you the opportunity of experiencing, first hand, the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; life of a wine buyer, except the travelling, we have already done it for you. We are looking for 40 people to help us to decide which new wines to add to our, already more than 250 wines, portfolio. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The evening, which will be held at Blackfriars in Newcastle, will give you an insight of what a wine buyer life is. There will be at least 20 wines on tasting and you will be required to taste all of them and to fill a wine card with your comments for every wine, spittoons will be provided in case you really want to act like a proper wine expert. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The wines on tasting will include the Italian Classic Method Sparkling wine, Franciacorta, and Amarone only to mention a couple. The event is free, however, to avoid places being booked without certainty of being able to attend, we are charging &pound;10 per person which include a bottle of wine worth at least &pound;10 to take home at the end of the evening. \r\n\

We all know the Pizza, but Campania is not just that, whilst, with regard to Trentino, sometime even Italians, don&rsquo;t know much about it. The menu will feature typical dishes of those 2 regions with matching wines and together we will discover these fantastic regions. \r\n\
    The tasting will be held at The Open Kitchen restaurant in Gosforth, Newcastle. Places are limited to 25 so please book in advance to avoid disappointment\r\n"

    The case includes 2 bottles each of the following wines:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Merlot</b>, Coceani\r\n\
    A medium bodied red wine with an intense nose of roses and slightly herbaceous, full and harmonious in the mouth\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Trebbiano d&rsquo;Abruzzo</b>, Jasci & Marchesani\r\n\
    A full bodied, white wine with a gold colour, a full and intense nose with aromas of white fruit and a long ending\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Riesling</b>, Jasci & Marchesani\r\n\
    An unusual, riesing with an attractive, complex bouquet with floral and tropical aromas and an extra bit of weight that you would expect from grapes grown in a hotter and sunnier climate\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Refosco del peduncolo</b>, Montalbano\r\n\
    A red wine with an intense, ruby red colour and a very good structure with a nose of underwood fruits\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Cabernet Franc</b>, Montalbano\r\n\
    This red wine has an intense colour, inimitable herby aroma, almost of just cut hay, which is aggressive when young but then it grows aristocratic when mature. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <b>Falanghina</b>, Masseria frattasi\r\n\
    A full bodied white wine that shows tempting aromas of apples and pears with underlying notes of almonds and a mineral finish\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    We reserve the right to substitute a product of equal or higher value in the event of supply difficulties. Vintages may vary from those shown.\r\n"

  description: "Jasci & Marchesani is a family run estate with vineyards in Abruzzo along the Adriatic cost and has been growing grapes organically since 1978. With vineyards located between the Apennines and the sea, with the mountains protecting the vines and the sea ensuring that the temperature never drops too low during the winter, the results are exceptional wines full of character. The grapes planted include autochthon grapes such as the Montepulciano and the Trebbiano D&rsquo;Abruzzo and more international ones such as the Cabernet Sauvignon or the Chardonnay that have found in the Jasci & Marchesani estate their perfect habitat. Jasci & Marchesani keeps experimenting implanting new grapes and using new wine making technique. \r\n\
    This double magnum is also the perfect gift idea not only for wine lovers. \r\n\
    \r\n\

    Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is a deeply colored, full-bodied organic red wine."

  description: Outstanding, complex, rich, full, silky. This <b>Chianti Classico Riserva</b> is all of the above and much more. Made using only the best Sangiovese grapes and aged in small barrels, barriques, it has a ruby color tending to garnet with ageing, is complex on the nose with, initially, hints of vanilla that then become berries, tobacco, smoke, and many more aromas. In the mouth is well balanced, round, elegant, silky and harmonious. The finish is long and with a fine and delicate aftertaste. To fully appreciate the wine, it is recommended to decant it

  description: "Sardinia is an Italian island that, due to its location, has kept their traditions, in fact there are very few influences of external cultures visible in their heritage and in their cuisine and at the same time, the island, being isolated by the rest of the world has created a cuisine made with ingredients that were easy to find on the island and where the main elements were fish for the population living along the coast and meat for those living inland. The tasting will feature dishes typical of the Sardinian cuisine accompanied by their most typical and known wines and it will be visible how, the wines perfectly match the food, and will also showcase, the only Cannonau white produced. Cannonau is a red grape, but like any red grape, can also be made white. At the moment Cantina di Dorgali is the only producer that does it and it very interesting to taste the same grape and see the difference made by leaving the juice with the skins and stalks.\r\n\

    Two fantastic everyday wines made from native Latium grapes at a great price:
    
    <b>Donnardea Colli Albani</b>
    A fantastic dry white wine. Made with native grapes from vineyards surrounding the city of Rome, this dry white wine is slightly aromatic with floral aromas and an enduring aftertaste. Excellent as an aperitif and to accompany light meals
    
    <b>Lazio Rosso</b>
    Made with Sangiovese, Merlot and Cesanese from vineyards surrounding the city of Rome, this medium bodied red wine is round, soft and very smooth on the palate with floral aromas with scents of roses. Wine for all courses

  description: This <b>Barolo Cerequio 2001</b>, made with Nebbiolo grapes from old vines of a single vineyard, called Cerequio, with a very low yield in the heart of the Barolo area, in La Morra, is one of the best expressions. Produced only in thousand bottles per year, these are sold well before being bottled. This 2001 vintage, a very good vintage for <b>barolo</b> wines, has an intense garnet colour, with aromas of black currant and red fruits with an underlying hints of vanilla. Elegant, well balanced, full bodied and complex with an enduring aftertaste and amazing sweet tannins. This wine has won several national and international awards including the Bronze medal at the International wine challenge
