  description: "<div style=\"color:black;\">It has never been more important looking for quality wine and food, the ones that offer true value for money and this has always been Italyabroad.com philosophy, offering real value for money. To celebrate the harvesting, we want to do better, offering <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold\">FREE UK DELIVERY</span> and <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold\"> 30% OFF FOR ONE WEEK ONLY</span> the normal price on a selection of wines and 10% OFF on all others.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I have said many times that you get what you pay for when it comes to wine and now, the Decanter World Wine awards has proved that this is true. Decanter judges said that consumers should expect to pay an average of £6.99 for a 'decent bottle of wine', however at Italyabroad.com, you can spend less for a more than decent bottle of wine, why not try our <a href =\"http://www.italyabroad.com/products/show/248-pinot-grigio-delle-venezie-dal-cero\"><font color=\"#CC0000\"> Pinot grigio</font></a> which is now <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold\"> only £6.94</span>\r\n\

  description: "<font color=\"#000000\">Tonight on TV on Channel 4 at 8pm Dispatches will reveal what is in a bottle of cheap wine and it seems that there is little wine, for a preview, <a href =\" http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1055820/Why-selling-wines-alcopops-dressed-flavourings-fancy-labels.html\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#CC0000\"> click here </font></a>. This program is already making lot of noise before even being broadcasted and I am sure it will raise a lot of questions and I will be writing about it on my blog in the next couple of days.  \r\n\
    \r\n\
    What surprises me about this program, based on what I read, is that suddenly everyone is against them including the wine writers that until last Sunday always shop in supermarkets for their wines. If you read the article, please be aware that in the old world, oak chips, by law, are not allowed. If a wine is oaked is because it has been aged in barrels. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    At Italyabroad.com we are proud to say that our wines are real wines, don't give you any headache and are made from small producers using little if none chemical and to give you the opportunity to try them, we have selected some of them and reduced by 30%. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Last week I also wrote a posting on my <a href =\" http://www.italyabroad.com/The-real-Italian-wine-guide-from-an-insider\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#CC0000\"> blog </font></a> about the best Italian wines guide published by The Guardian.\r\n\

    Last week on the TV program we heard about wines from supermarkets.

    Our wines are different, they offer fantastic value for money because they are made by some of the best small and passionate producers, that own and look after their vineyards and not bottling companies and to allow you to taste the difference between our wines and the others, we are offering you a mixed case with a saving of more than £30 and a free bottle of extra virgin olive, cold pressed, oil from Umbria and up to 30% discount on all other produces. \r\n\

    Christmas is around the corner and we are pleased to announce that once again, we were able to get some of the finest biscuits and panettones from our preferred Pasticceria in Prato (Tuscany), they will be with us towards the end of the month and I suggest you to order them sooner than later because we always run out of them . \r\n\
    \r\n\
    In my wine tasting classes we like tasting and comparing wines from different sources and so far, all my students found our wines better value for money compared to the supermarkets' one and they were very surprised when they found out the cost. I always ask my student to guess the cost of the wine and guess what, they always thought our wines were more expensive than their real cost, on the other side, they always though supermarkets wines were cheaper than their cost. For Christmas we have chosen six superb, fantastic quality full bodied red wines and have discounted them of an additional 10% only for this week and only for the first 50 orders and if the weather is not good, you can drink them in a rainy afternoon. \r\n\

    \r\n\
    I hadn't posted on my blog for sometime due to the many commitments and tastings, so last week end I found some free time and decided to write something about <a href =\" http://www.italyabroad.com/The-real-Italian-wine-guide-from-an-insider/show/31-the-truth-behind-cheap-wines \"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> value for money </font></a> wine following a survey made by Which about fake supermarket promotions.

    <div style="color:black;">
    I am very pleased to announce that one of our wines has been recently voted as the best Italian white wine of the year, this make us very proud and proves the quality of our noses in finding fantastic wines. 
    
    I am also pleased to announce that our website is finally completed, we have moved the site to a bigger server and now everything should be fine and faster. 
    
    Last week, during our move, the site was down for a few hours and, with a big surprise, we have received several emails from some of you (thank you very much if you were one of them) informing us that the site was down. 
    
    These emails made appearing a big smile on our faces and told us that we are doing well, that our customers love our wines and like us, cannot live without them.
    
    To celebrate all of this, we are offering you the Pomedes at a very special price.

    I have said many times that you get what you pay for when it comes to wine and now, the Decanter World Wine awards has proved that this is true. Decanter judges said that consumers should expect to pay an average of £6.99 for a 'decent bottle of wine', however at Italyabroad.com, you can spend less for a more than decent bottle of wine, why not try our <a href =\"http://www.italyabroad.com/products/show/172-lazio-rosso-igt-donnardea\"><font color=\"#CC0000\"> Lazio Rosso</font></a>.\r\n\
