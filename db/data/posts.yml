  description: "We would like to be able to transmit our passion and more than that, the passion of the producers themselves. Unfortunately this is very difficult, therefore, I apologies if it is taking a bit longer to put all our produce range online and write their descriptions. Together with the website and our produce range, we have just selected a few more producers and soon I will tell you a bit more about them, our company grows. It is not too difficult to find people with skills and at the same time that love wine and food. Yes, to be part of our team you need to share our same values and part of the recruitment process is about tasting wine and food. In the last few months, Italyabroad.com has gone from strength to strength and we added two more people to our team, Thao and Raffaele, and we are now looking for bigger premises. Hopefully soon, as soon as we make some space, I will take a photograph of all of us and you will be able to see our faces as well we are a great bunch of dreamers with a big passion for wine and food. Lastly, something about our produces. One of our wines, Cannonau Vigna di Isalle, has been given the Italian Oscar (only 3 red wines and 3 white wines) from the Gambero Rosso for its value for money, this made us proud. We don't make the wine but we discover it and I think our taste is not bad.."

  page_title: Italian wines on the press.. incorrect information

  description: "A few days ago I received a copy of the magazine Taste Italia and reading through I came across the wines reviewed by Brian St Pierre and once again, he picked all wined from the major supermarkets and even called Oddbins a specialist, I meant Italian specialist. I have been at Oddbins a few times and they are all but Italian specialists, they currently stock a few Italian wines and I personally think that you can find better wines at better value for money there. I  receive the magazine every month and every month the nearly totality of the wines reviewed come from a supermarket, I agreed with are the easiest to find, but I also think a wine writer should go beyond the obvious and really find a specialist wine shop. I don't really read the wine reviews, not knowing the wines, there is no much to say, but this time I came across a couple of, for me, incorrect information. The first one relates to the Chianti. Chianti is a DOCG wine and like all the DOCG wines, not much is left to the winemaker a part from a small percentage of grapes to use amongst a list of allowed grapes. This is the exactly the same for the Chianti Classico. In the review, Brian St Pierre, says that one advantage of wine making outside the Classico zone in Chianti s that there are fewer tradition-bound restrictions, I don't know what I meant but the wine makers have exactly the same choice when making the wine. There are producers that go for the tradition, using only Sangiovese, whilst there are others that prefer using blending the Sangiovese with other grapes as to make the wine more round and ready to drink. \r\n\
    The second, incorrect information is his introduction to the Orvieto Classico, where it says that Orvieto's whites are blends, which hasn't always been something to brag about... Orvieto Classico is the wine made with different grapes from vineyards located around the town of Orvieto in Umbria and it is a blend, however I don't agree with the second part of the statement. It is like all blends are something not to brag about whilst plenty of fantastic Italian wines are blend. Chianti can be when not 100% Sangiovese and many are not, Frascati, Amarone are all blends and the problem is not the blend but the producer who can make a good wine like the Orvieto become undrinkable. This is the main issue for Italian wines, too many producers and therefore it is difficult to find good wines without searching and looking and recently, another wine importer told me that I was giving up on Italian wines because he was too time consuming finding them and promoting them, because even when you find a good producer, only the small are left, you need to promote the wine and small producers don't understand it. Concluding this post, blends can be good or bad, it all depends on the producers.\r\n"

  description: "I have noticed that Italian wines are becoming more and more rare, from supermarkets to newspaper wine pages. One of the reasons behind this is the difficulty in finding good producers as I have already mentioned in other posting. Another reason is that the wines that are available, bottled by the usual big companies that don't make good wine but have the resources to make their wines international, are pushing wine drinkers away from Italian wines making poor quality wines. I recently went back to Italy and was very surprised when I stopped in a supermarket, the equivalent of Tesco, and could not see any of the wines available from the supermarkets in the UK. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Supermarkets put pressure on winemakers, not just Italian, requesting a certain wine at a certain price and only big bottlers can respond and fulfil their requests. A suggestion I can give you, is to stay away from wines that are made by producers that seem to have vineyards all over Italy, from Sicily to Veneto. There are none. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    On the other side, wine writers don't go the extra mile to find good Italian wines, they simply look in front of their eyes and if the wines are not there, then do not exist. Italy has a long history in making wine and in the last few years, is producing some outstanding wine, whether it is the rich, elegant, complex and structured one or the easy to drink, full of flavour, refreshing one. The problem for Italian wine is that because of all these poor quality wines available, wine drinkers prefer not to risk and buy a wine from a different country. I will invite you to try and don't give up after your first attempt and if you need any advice I am always available. In our quest for Italian wines, in a few weeks time we will be going to the Vinitaly and will bring back plenty of new wines that hopefully will find your approval, we have recently added the <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/products/show/pecorino-jasci-marchesani\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">Pecorino</a></font> from Jasci & Marchesani.

The stats given on the radio also showed that, based on number of hospital admissions, the number of youngster admitted is on the up.  The response given by the industry is that setting a minimum price, it will penalise also the responsible drinkers. I don't agree with this response at all. I think that if the government set a minimum price per unit, not only the number of people misusing alcohol will decrease considerably, especially the youngster, but consumers will start buying wine because of their quality and not price, so the all attitude towards wine and alcoholic drinks in general will change, initiating an educational journey that will only have positive effects on the industry as a whole."

  description: "Have we got to the point that we worry too much about the presentation and too little about the wine? Is the label so important? Does the shape or color of the label tell us anything about the wine?  In Italy we have a saying that says good looking labels are made to hide poor quality wines. This is not always the case nowadays, but it has some true. Simply look at the cheapest wines and then the most expensive, which have the better looking labels? I bet the cheapest. We should not generalise, though. New world wineries have a complete different attitude towards label. Their wines have always been made thinking as the good looking label necessary, or maybe is the fact that their wines do not have the story or history of old world wines. For old wine wineries, all it matters is the wine, what inside the bottle, everything else is unnecessary. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I can understand that when looking for a bottle of wine in a supermarket's aisle, considering that the tasting notes seems to say the same for all wines, the only difference is the label and we assume that the better looking as the better wine, but not in restaurants, even if now supermarkets are starting to stock normal label wines on the shelves to deceive their customers, on the premium range, giving the impression that they are buying a small production wine, restaurants are now going the other direction. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    A couple of days ago I have received a call from the manager of one of the restaurants we supply complaining about one of the wines we supply them with. It took me a few minutes to understand that the complaint was not about the wines itself, but was about the label. There was nothing wrong with the wine but simply the manager thought that because of the label the wine would not sell. I have to precise that the label has nothing wrong, it is simply the combination of a classic wine and a small producer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This call left me speechless and shocked and the only thing I could say was that if he was not happy about the label I would have arranged for the wine to be taken back. I was also amazed to hear that the manager was happy to pay a bit more for a better label, without even taking into consideration what was inside the bottle. After the conversation, I agreed to take the wine back, I started thinking about the call and I felt disappointed, because, if restaurants, are starting to buy wines by the label, it will be the end of wine as I know it. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Restaurants are, supposedly, the place where customers are guided in their wine choice and don't get the chance to look at the bottle until the wine gets to the table.  Wine is no different from food, would you prefer a fantastic presentation dish with no flavour or a not so great looking but with plenty of flavours? So, what to look for when buying your wine? Origin, producer and grape. Read the back label instead of stopping on the front one. Don't be scared of bad looking labels, you may will find an hidden gem. "

  description_short: For the coming Christmas we are all making room in our cellar for the right wines for our days and nights in with friends and families. My Christmas wines will be Prosecco to start with, plenty of full bodies, rich, complex aged red for the classic Italian meals and the traditional Spumante to accompany the Panettone and to welcome the New Year. Christmas festive season in Italy is made by days spent eating and drinking. Long meals, plenty of food eaten and wine drunk outside when visiting friends and families, a marathon harder than the real one if you are not fit. Somehow, Italians got something in their DNA about this capacity of enjoying food and wine in bigger quantities.

Somehow, Italians got something in their DNA about this capacity of enjoying food and wine in bigger quantities.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But this habit is now becoming common even outside Italy and therefore, full bodied, rich, complex and aged wines are present in many tables to complement the meals. We could also call these wines festive wines, because we are all happy to spend a few pounds more for one of them. Examples of these wines are Barolo or Brunello di Montalcino only to mention two. But be very careful if you don't want to spoil your Christmas meal, make sure you pick the right vintage. The wines I have mentioned are wines that are aged in barrels and need sometime to give their best after they are bottled and therefore, when spending the money you spend for them, make sure you pick the right one. Forget about 2004 or even 2003 vintage if you want to drink it now, opt for the 2001 or lower which you can be certain is ready to complement your meal and impress your friends. If you are not sure, ask for advice, shop assistant, sommelier. You can also ask us if you have any doubt, just make sure you don't waste your money and your meal, it would be a very disappointing Christmas meal. \r\n"

A symptom of this conversion is the so called scandal of the Brunello di Montalcino which should be, by law, made by only Sangiovese Grosso but in reality, it was recently discovered is not. It had small percentages of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that were added simply to make the wine more round, soft and more ready to drink, exactly as Parker likes it. I recently went to a tasting of Tuscan wines in Italy and I was very disappointed of finding Tuscan wines such as Chianti and Nobile di Montepulciano, wines made with Sangiovese, smoother and rounder as they have never been  Whilst the Brunello by law can only be made by Sangiovese grosso, for these other wines the law allows small percentages of other grapes, and I could taste them more than ever. The downside of it was that, at least for me, what made these wines unique, had gone.  I think this is a shame and I damaging the industry and us, wine lovers that enjoy a glass of wine and love tasting and discovering new and unique wines. What I don't understand is why someone can tell us what to drink and also make the price jump to the sky simply because he has rated the wine 90+ and we are all happy to pay this premium even though, 99% of the times, we don't understand the wine, we possibly don't like it but tell everyone that we tasted a wine highly rated by Parker and it was good. Is that because we all want to appear wine experts and are afraid of what we think? I only had the opportunity to taste once two wines highly rated by Parker, I mean that in only one occasion, in a wine fair there was someone selling highly rated wines and I tasted two, I think one was 92 points and the other had a similar rating. For both wines I was, together with the seller, very disappointed but what the seller told me is that people were buying those wines simply because Parker had highly rated them. Obviously, there are also a lot of wines rated by Parker which are good, but what I don't like is that producers, especially in the old world, which has such a variety and differences in style, producers have started making wines to please him forgetting that wine was drunk thousands years before Parker and will be still drunk when Parker will stop writing about wine.

  description: "In one of my latest posting about wine and its cost, I received the following comment:\r\n\
    If you're buying wine in a supermarket, I don't think taste is top of the list on things your looking for in a wine. The British want cheap plonk that will get them drunk, end of story. And the supermarkets/gov't seem only to happy to give the people what they want. Keeps them from asking too many questions about what's really going on in this country. Wine education is key, then perhaps the public will start demanding flavourful wine!\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I don't totally agree with it, because if I did, I would be better leaving England and go somewhere else where wine drinkers can appreciate quality wines. I am sure that the government could do a lot better than increase duty on alcohol that only damage good wines and not the cheap, tasteless wine sold by the supermarkets. I also agree with the education bit; unfortunately, without education nothing will ever change. I started appreciating wine when I was a child and I always enjoyed it without abusing, this is for me the solution to all problems alcohol related. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Another solution will be for the government to set a minimum price, similar to what Scotland is doing, so that wine drinkers will look more carefully at what they buy and will increase awareness and reduce binge drinking. The problem is that plenty of wine is sold by supermarkets or big chains and without education, yes again, the only difference between two wines is the price and why pay more for something that looks exactly as the more expensive one? Small, independent wine merchants not only sell better wines but can offer plenty of advice and educate so that, next time, you can go alone. \r\n"

  description: "When choosing the drink to pair with a spicy dish, wine does not come top of the list even though more and more people are choosing it and amongst the different choices available, Italian wines are not amongst the firsts. As a rule of thumb, when looking for a wine to match spice food, you want low alcohol, fruity white wines to balance the dish or, if you are a fond of red, spicy red wines to complement it, some of the characteristics the wine should have are high acidity and a perceived sweetness.  Definitely to avoid, are high alcoholic, tannic reds and oaky whites. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Among Italian wines, good spicy food companion are <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/products/show/gewurztraminer-doc-alto-adige-egger-ramer\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Gew\xFCrztraminer </a></font>, <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/products/show/muller-thurgau-doc-alto-adige-egger-ramer\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Muller Thurgau </a></font>, whites, and <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/products/show/lagrein-gries-doc-alto-adige-egger-ramer\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Lagrein </a></font>, red, all from Trentino. These wines and grapes are often associated with Germany or Alsace but Italy produces some outstanding example. The main difference is in the alcohol content and the body, with the Italians being more alcoholic and more bodied. If in doubt or not too sure, the safest bet is to opt for the bubbles. Either Franciacorta or <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/products/show/spumante-pinot-chardonnay-dal-cero\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Spumante </a></font> will comfortably sit next to a spicy dish due to their acidity. \r\n"

  description_short: "Can I have a bottle of Prosecco, please? Often when asking for a Prosecco in a restaurant, the real one, we are given something that has written Prosecco on the label but does not taste anything like the original. In the last few months, lots of different bottles with Prosecco on the label have flooded the market with big differences in price between them; by the way, when buying a bottle of Prosecco or sparkling wine in general, don't forget that they carry &pound;2.055 duty.

    \r\n\
    The same happens when buying a bottle of Prosecco from the Supermarkets, before there was only one type to choose from, now, there are many with no explanation of the differences between them. The Prosecco, in the last couple of years has seen its consumption growing significantly, accelerated by the recession, where many lovers of bubbles, have switched their drinking habit from Champagne to Prosecco, because a good Prosecco is better than a bottle of champagne at twice the price. \r\n\
    Prosecco is a grape,  and therefore every wine made using the grape can use the name on the label, this is a partial explanation of the number of different Proseccos available. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The grape can be vinified still, semi sparkling and spumante and very often the confusion is between the last two. Semi sparkling or vino frizzante are wines that have undergone a partial second fermentation, whilst the Prosecco spumante are sparkling wine that have completed the second fermentation using the Charmat method. Examples of semy sparkling wines are the Lambrusco and the Asti. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Prosecco spumante, made in Veneto, find its best expressions in the wines coming from the <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/product-search?text=prosecco\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">Conegliano-Valdobbiadene</font></a> and Cartizze areas. Recently, a change in Italian law, has elevated the status of Prosecco coming from these areas as DOCG lowering the yield per hectare and therefore, reducing the production. So, if you are looking for the Prosecco, then look for the word spumante on the label. If you read vino frizzante it is the semi sparkling wine. "

He asked me to read the back label and with great surprise I noticed that in the M&S house rose', the back label was saying that the majority of grapes used in making the wine were coming from Abruzzo, a region in the north/west of Italy. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    He knew I come from Abruzzo, which is located on the centre of Italy, facing the Adriatic sea, so centre/east, and he wanted to see my reaction. I was very surprised, it is sufficient to take a map of Italy and find out where Abruzzo is if unsure. But this made me thinking of how the labels are made. A part that a wine that say that the majority of grapes used come from Abruzzo without then specifying them should not exist, there are big differences between grapes and the resulting wines. Using the region does not say anything because a rose' made with Montepulciano is completely different from a rose' made with Sangiovese even if both from Abruzzo, but, if the region is wrong, and I don't think this has been a printing mistake, to me it looked like they don't have a clue of what it is inside the bottle.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Together with the rose', he also brought a bottle of house red and white and the style of the bottle was the same, same wine maker, someone I have never heard of, and majority of grapes coming from different regions. Sicily for the red and I don't remember for the white. When buying the wine I want to know what grape is in the bottle, because, amongst many other elements that the grape tells me, there is also the fairness of the price. It is like M&S would put a label saying steak on a piece of meat without specifying whether it is beef or venison. After having a laugh about the label, we left saying that the following day we would have gone together to M&S to look at their Italian wine selection. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    We went and I was not really impressed by them, they had the usual suspects, but I was surprised by their way of selling the wines, their descriptions. For example they were describing their Amarone as made following the traditional rich method which I have never heard of.  There is only one way of making Amarone, the only difference could be in the ageing method used but there is no rich method. I can only assume that was an Amarone made according to the tradition, a wine that needed time to refine in the bottle before being ready, not an Amarone made to please some wine writers that does not like to wait, but if this was the case, a 2006 vintage was too young and they should have added on the description that the wine needed a bit more time. The Amarone was not the only one and there were plenty of funny descriptions, descriptions made to capture consumers, for consumers not knowledgeable about wine and trusting the supermarket in their advice. Never trust a supermarket fancy descriptions. \r\n"

  description_short: "Yesterday I was reading the newspaper and I read about a MP calling the chairman of Tesco as the godfather of binge drinking and then I received a mail from the WSTA (wine and spirit trade association) to which I belong asking for information for a survey on how an increase of alcohol duty will affect the trade and I decided to write about it. Binge drinking is a problem. "

  description: "The solution the government is suggesting is to increase the duty once again. I don't think this is the correct solution. The end result of this policy is to put out of business small merchants selling quality wine and to help big supermarkets like Tesco in selling cheap wine and make even more money. There will always be, does not matter the rate of duty, a place where it is possible to buy a bottle of wine for &pound;2.99. This was 7 years ago when I first came here and this is today and the duty has constantly increased budget after budget. For me the solution lies in two areas, education and intervention in the cheap wine sale, what has now started to happen in Scotland. A moderate consumption of wine is healthy, this has been proved by several studies and a nice glass of wine is also a pleasure, too many is a no. They damage our health. This is the first message the government should send out. The second area in which the government should intervene is the sale of cheap wine which is the cause of binge drinking. I would like to invite everyone to think that, paying a bottle of wine &pound;2.99 or even &pound;3.99, taking off the VAT and the duty, the wine becomes cheaper than a branded bottle of mineral water and the last comes in a plastic bottle and does not require any additional work if not bottling it. A bottle of wine is the result of at least 12 months spent in the vineyards, under the rain or the hot summer sun, and in the cellar. If on the other side, the product is sold at a price below cost, this cost is normally borne by the producers which then opens a lot of ethical issue in a world that has, rightly, become so concerned about ethic and fair trade. How can we be happy to buy local to sustain the local economy paying more and then buy a &pound;2.99 bottle of wine without thinking of the people behind it, they are not near us but they exist. Will we be happy to give the produces of our gardens, the result of our hard work, at less than what they cost us? I won't. In Italy we have this old say, I was told you have the same here, you get what you pay for and this is more than ever true. This applies to everything, not just wine. "

Interested in Italian wines but lost when looking for them in a supermarket shelf? Buying Italian wines is becoming increasingly more and more difficult, but before giving you tips on what to look for, a few things should be said about making wine in Italy. "

  description: "Interested in Italian wines but lost when looking for them in a supermarket shelf? Buying Italian wines is becoming increasingly more and more difficult, but before giving you tips on what to look for, a few things should be said about making wine in Italy. Italian law allows only four types of wine: vino da tavola (table wine), IGT, DOC, DOCG. In the case of DOCG wines, Italian law says how the wine should be made and the grapes that should be used, leaving little or none to the wine maker. Examples are the Barolo and Brunello to mention a couple. When a wine has the DOC strip, the law says that the grapes come from a specific area which could be a region, like Abruzzo for the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo or more limited, like the Frascati area for the Frascati, however, the DOC areas are listed by the law. DOCG and DOC wines can also additional requirements such as the alcohol percentage and yield. When a wine has instead the IGT (indicazione geografica tipica) mention on the label means that the grapes come from a specific area and the area is not a DOC one. Everything else is vino da tavola, table wine. On top of that, there are plenty of other adjectives, from \"Superiore\" (superior) to \"Classico\" (Classic) that refers to the characteristics of the wine the first and the area of provenance of the grapes the second, or \"Amabile\" or \"Abboccato\" which indicates the sugar content left. All the above does not have anything to do with the quality of the wine. You can find vino da tavola of a very good quality and DOCG undrinkable. DOC and IGT wines are, on the other side, the signature wines, wines that the producers can create, experiment with and succeed. Examples of them are the Sassicaia and Pomedes only to mention a couple. These wines are made with grapes from a specific area but is the wine maker that creates the wine, deciding the blend, the ageing, etc and this can change every year. Said that, another important element to mention that does not apply for new world wine and also partially explains the price gap, is that the law does not allow procedures that new world wine makers can use. An example above all is the ageing process. When an Italian wine is aged means aged in barrels, small or tonneaux (big barrels), new world wines can be aged by using chips of wood. The chips are left in the juice until the desired aged taste is obtained. Many experiments have been conducted about the effect of chips on the wine but a unanimous conclusion has not been reached yet. Going back to the tips, there are several elements that needs to be considered when buying Italian wines. Let's start with origin and producer. These two elements are both very important. We all know that the same grape produce different wines if planted in different areas and we also know that not all the areas are suitable or produce the same result. An example could be the Sangiovese, that in Tuscany produces wines like the Brunello even though is planted all over the centre/south of Italy but without resulting in any exceptional wines. With regard to the producer, it is important to know who made the wine, whether a wine maker or a commercial company that buys the wine and put into a bottle for the reason we can all imagine. Another important element to consider when buying aged wine is the vintage, this applies to all wines not just Italian. There are wines that require several years in bottle, eg Barolo, before being ready to be drunk and unless we want to keep the wine in the cellar, we need to buy an old vintage, otherwise the moment we drink the wine, we will find it unbalanced and unpleasant. Not only this, but each vintage is different due to the different weather conditions, and it is important to pick the right vintage as to avoid disappointment. Follow these simple tips will save you money and ensure you will enjoy your purchase."

  description: "I am not a fan of wine competitions, however, especially in the UK market, a relatively young market, they are important; they help in selling wine, especially supermarkets' wines where there is no advice and wines are sold by the attractiveness of the label, their price or the review or award received. Only a couple of days ago, when walking down the wine aisle, I was surprised to read, next to the price tag, vintage 2006 medal winner, the only problem was that were selling a 2008 vintage, it was a Pinot Grigio at Tesco. In the same supermarket, another wine, a Valpolicella Ripasso, had an extract of a review saying a nice valpo ect. I don't know whether they had shortened the review, but a valpolicella is a completely different wine from the Ripasso, and I am not even entirely sure the review was referring to the same wine however, both examples prove the important of award/review for consumers when choosing a wine. There are plenty more examples I could mention. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Competitions are very important when selling wine and every year, in every competition, plenty of wines are entered, especially by supermarkets and big producers. On the other side, due to their cost, plenty of fantastic wines made from small vineries never get tasted or drunk. Competitions are a big business and generate large revenue for the organisers, there are company that make profits based on a single competition and to get vineries to enter their wines, recruit panels of stars, wine stars, as judges. However, I take competitions' results with care. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I have sat in a few Italian wine tastings as a judge and I can ensure you that it is a hard work and do believe there is a limit on the wines that can be tasted in a session. I don't believe in wine experts when saying that they can taste, with the same freshness and open mind, hundreds of wines per day. I also believe that judges have their own taste that has an impact on the evaluation of the wine and the result can be affected, even decided, by external causes to the wine itself. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I have been personally witness of two episodes proving what I am saying above about wine competitions and judges and their limited value. In 2006 I have entered the same wine at the Decanter World Wine awards and the International Wine and Spirit competition, it received a gold medal at the first competition and not even a mention on the second. What happened? Was the wine fantastic or poor? I think the answer lies somewhere toward the gold medal, however, something went wrong. Wines should be judged objectively and result should be similar between different competitions.   \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The other case I have witnessed refers to a Tuscan wine aged for 4 months in new barrels. The wine was entered at the last year International Wine Challenge and received a bronze medal. The vintage was 2006 and at the time of the tasting for the competition, the wine had only a few months of bottle and it needed a few more for the tannins to soften. The reason the wine only got a bronze medal, according to the judge/s, was too tannic. When I read the motivation I was very surprised, I was expecting the judge/s to know that aged wine needs time in bottle. If the same judge/s were tasting the wine now, would find it soft, smooth, with delicate, nearly sweet, tannins and would probably give it a gold medal. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    My suggestion is to take awards with caution, doubting of wine sold simply because of their award or rating and to run away from merchants that only sells rated or winning wine, if they do, they probably buy wines because someone else like them and they cannot tell you anything about the wine and the wine maker. I would also invite you to post comments about any awarded wine that disappointed you and vice versa, any wine that really impressed you. Try to keep Italian if you can.\r\n"

  description: "Below the letter I sent to the Times about the recent proposal of banning drinking advertising.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sir, I was very surprised to read that one of the solution for the binge drinking problem, especially the under age one, according to the BMA, is attributed to advertising; it is like if we would ban condom brands advertising because it could push more youngster to have sex and therefore, contribute to teenage pregnancy. And, if advertising is the main cause of the problem, why, all money spent by the government in their campaign against binge drinking does not work? It should not work the same way? It has also been said to ban drinking companies to sponsor events, with many of them being cultural. These events, if it was not for these sponsorships, would never been realised because the audience is insignificant for any other industry and, without them, we will all be a little more ignorant. Is this what we want?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The main issue is cultural, and will take time to change it, however, a more immediate action that the government can take is to stop the cheap drink industry. If it was not for them, binge drinking will be a luxury. You can imagine binge drinking with bottles of wine worth &pound;10? Not only, if this problem is not tackled, the only winners are the supermarkets, and everyone loses and the problem gets worst.  The NHS; the conscientious drinkers, because every time the problem is mentioned, the government increases the duty; the producers that are squeezed even more by the supermarkets; the consumers, because cheap is synonym of poor quality; the other retailers because they need to put prices up every time the government increased duty therefore losing customers; the workers that in third world countries are even more exploited by the producers that need to match supermarkets' prices; the workers in the industrialised countries because producers cut jobs to reduce cost, again, to match supermarkets' prices. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Unfortunately supermarkets have too much power, both, versus the consumers and the suppliers and getting this equilibrium is part of the solution. It is difficult to understand how, with the duty constantly going up, the wine is cheaper now than a few years ago. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The binge drinking problem requires a carefully planned and thought solution, not instinctive actions dictated by emotional situations and the problem does not lie in the advertising but it is a lot more complex and will not be resolved banning advertising. \r\n"

  description: "I finally got back home, it took me a bit longer than expected but I made it and I started to celebrate the festive season the Italian way with family and friends. It all started on Christmas evening, with a long meal, that according to tradition includes, depending on the town of origin, 7 or 13 different dishes with none of them containing meat. In other Italian area, the Christmas evening dinner is even more important than the Christmas day and ends with all family going together to the church for the Christmas mass. Where I come from, a small town in Abruzzo, on Christmas eve, we have 7 different dishes and we have a big and long meal on Christmas day. As every year, my mum and grandma have been preparing for it for the last few days. Making a Christmas meal following the tradition includes plenty of hand made pasta, soup made slowly cooking a real chicken and plenty of locally grown meat and hand made cakes and biscuits including the Panettone. In my parents' home, not having professional cooking appliances, it takes a few days to prepare everything. Whilst my mum and grandma prepared the food, my dad and me, prepared the wine list and ensured that all wines were ready for the event. We made sure that all red wines were brought from the cellar in the kitchen and their temperature rose up to 16/18 degrees, so called room temperature, all white wines went to the fridge and aged wines were opened a few hours before their use and put in a decanter to oxygenate. Christmas in Italy, especially in small towns, is not just about food and wine, but it is also about seeing family and friends. And when you live away of your loved one like I do, Christmas suddenly becomes something you look forward to because you are sure everyone else will be there too and you will be able to see people you haven't seen for a year. I wish you plenty all the best and hope you are enjoying it as I am."

I read recently on a <a href=\" http://www.drvino.com/2009/09/14/study-wine-points-influence-consumer-perceptions/\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> post </font></a>on Dr Vino blog of the result of the study carried out by the ETH Zurich and published in the journal Appetite that concludes that the opinions of wine critics have an impact on a wine drinker's sense of taste . I agree with Dr Vino that the results are not surprising at all. To see how the rating influence consumer perception and willingness to pay more, all we need to do is to look at the wines on the supermarkets' shelves showing ratings or medals and their prices. Or the number of wines entered by each and every supermarket in the major wine competition to win a medal; I don't think that these competitions could be run if it wasn't for the supermarkets. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    With regard to the question raised by Dr Vino about the opinion of the group with no prior information about the wine that has not been addressed by the study, I think it has been answered somehow when it says that the people who were told the rating afterwards rated the wine better than the group who were told that the wine had been given 72 points by Parker and worse than the group who were told that the wine had been given 92 points , to me it says that consumers tend to stay in the middle.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Unfortunately, we don't have many Robert Kenney and probably we would never had any Sierra Carche incident if Robert Kenney had only bought a few bottles like the majority of consumers and not several cases of a 40$ wine. Consumers do take ratings very seriously and often, if they don't like a good rated wine, they are afraid to say it. It will be a lot better and the good wine would be cheaper if consumers would trust their taste a bit more and less the ratings given by wine critics, there is still a long way to go before consumers will openly challenge the score given to a wine by a wine critic.\r\n"

I find this unusual; I have to admit that the majority of wine writers do exactly the same, reviewing the same wines from the same retailers. I think wine writers should go beyond supermarkets, do the extra mile and discover unseen wines and grapes and not keep writing vintage after vintage about the same wine from the same shop sometime even giving incorrect information. On the 12th of June, on the Times Magazine Jane Macquitty reviewed for the second vintage in a row, a Gavi from Tesco made by Fratelli Martini. If you ask in Piedmont about Fratelli Martini and their wines, they will probably look at you like you were from another planet. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Fratelli Martini is one of those companies that buy the grapes or the wine and then put them in bottles with their own labels, you may have tasted their Asti Spumante that put so many people off, and knowing this, the review made me laughing. For the 2007 vintage Jane says hand-harvested cortese grapes and for the 2006 she even said grown on Fratelli Martini's best hillside sites and hand-harvested. To be certain, I have even visited the company website, the Italian version, where in the land section, it confirms that the grapes used are bought from nearly thousand Italian wine makers. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Going back to the letter sent to the editor, below the text and her response and please let us know what your opinion is and if you trust wine writers or not. \r\n\
    Dear Editor,\r\n\
    I am writing to you following the Wine and Dine article appeared on your magazine on the latest issue. As a wine expert and lover of Italian wines, I find the reviews written by your writer uninspiring in the sense that the only wines featured are the ones available from supermarkets, he never goes the extra mile for more interesting wines. In addition to that, in his last article he complains about the supermarket range made by 10 pinot grigios and 8 chiantis. The reason behind it, and I am sure he is aware of, is because supermarkets don't have the staff to sell interesting wines and therefore they sell wine that people pick from the shelves and the wines mentioned above are a clear example. On top of that, Italian wine makers and wines, because of their huge number, are different from any other country and supermarkets don't have the knowledge and resources to search, so they rely on big wine makers.  \r\n\
    Secondly, big wine makers, the one that your writer writes about, make the wines that consumers want, buying grapes and putting them into their bottle with, in many cases, not even growing the grape. Supermarkets also need to ensure a certain quantity and the majority of Italian grapes are only grown in small areas and with a limited production and therefore never get to the supermarket, also due to the higher cost in making them. From an expert point of view, the wines from supermarkets are certainly not the best examples of Italian wines. There are plenty of small producers that can offer better wines at a similar price and I am sure that your readers will appreciate the magazine and the section more if these wines were featured instead of something available from Tesco which has been made for Tesco or keeping the cost in mind.\r\n\
    Lastly, your writer mention grapes that according to him are worth trying however, these are now out of fashion, because supermarkets have started, due to the characteristics of the grapes (eg Nero d'avola for its high alcoholic content or primitivo), selling very poor and cheap wines that put customers off whilst there are plenty of fantastic wines and regions that are now coming to fashion and should be written about.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Response\r\n\

    Thanks for writing in - it's great to get feedback on the magazine. Brian St Pierre is a well-known and well-respected wine writer, but the reason that so many supermarket wines are featured is because we need to make sure that the wines are accessible to everyone and cater to all levels of knowledge.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Of course, he is aware that Italy has more to offer than is reflected in the wine pages. But I think that you are right - we could feature some of the lesser-known producers and wines. We do have to bear in mind that the many readers may not have the time or inclination to venture away from the supermarket for wine buying. In fact most readers are not big wine buffs, but have a greater interest in the food of Italy.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Anyway, I just wanted to let you know why the wine pages are so supermarket heavy and assure that we will make sure there is more of a mix in future issues.\r\n"

    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Dear Editor,\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I am an importer of Italian wine and have been reading on the papers about the debate that low alcohol wine has started with the biggest retailers building up plenty of stock for the coming Christmas season. I belong to the group of people that oppose to the introduction of low alcohol wine simply because I don't think that it will solve the problems this country is facing with regard to binge drinking and public disorder and is hoping to address with this wine and more than anything else, is not wine. Alcohol is a very important element of the wine. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Introducing a low alcohol wine will simply take people longer to get drunk, the problem is that many people drink simply to get drunk and therefore this solution will not solve the problem. I do believe that the only way to solve the problems we are facing as a country is through education. Wine dates back to 6000BC and not only is a drink but it has also been proved by many studies that it has healthy effects. However, like any abuse, has negative consequences. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    To obtain a low alcohol wine, like someone suggested, is sufficient to add water or lemonade into it. I remember when I was a child, growing up in a small Italian village where the beer was considered posh and everyone was making his own wine, the elderly of the village used to play cards drinking wine with gassosa, an Italian sort of lemonade, because they knew that otherwise they would have been drunk in a few games and they were playing for the whole afternoon. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    If we now introduce the low alcohol wine, what will be of the other alcoholic drinks? We will remove the alcohol from all drinks because plenty of us will switch their habits towards other alcoholic drinks? In the near future, to fight obesity, we will be taking off the supermarkets' shelves all fat food? I don't think this is the right direction.\r\n"

    Wine spectator recently gave the Excellence award to an italian restaurant that does not exist. Robin Goldstein, wine critic, in an attempt to prove the lack of any foundation behind many food and wine awards, entered to the Wine Spectator award of excellence a restaurant that does not exist and won. And what was even more surprising, when entering the award, the wine list entered included  some of the most poorly rated Italian wines by Wine Spectator. 
    
    This is not the first case and will not be the last. In 2005 the Michelin Guide gave 2 stars to a restaurant that had not opened yet and according to what the chef said at that time, the restaurant got the stars because of the good relationship it had with the guide. Today there are too many awards and competitions and everyone wants to win one. On the other side, each award or competition wants to be seen as the one. 
    
    I have recently read a post on James Suckling's Blog (Wine Spectator blogger) where a reader was asking about a wine that according to him was one of the best and had never won the three glasses Gambero Rosso (which is considered the bible of Italian wines) and he replied to the reader that there were plenty of rumours about the way the Gambero Rosso was awarding the three glasses. This posting was published before the Excellence award became news. 
    
    Another element to bear in mind is the cost involved in participating in these awards or competitions, which, according to my experience, leave out a lot of potential winners, not everyone can afford to spend several hundreds pounds to enter them whilst the organisations running the competition get quite a substantial stream of revenue and they need winners to be able to run the same competition the following year. In the case of the Wine spectator excellence award, 4500 restaurants entered the award and 4181 received the award or a similar mention, a staggering 93% of the total.

A few nights were about chickens, then ready meals and more will come. It seems that suddenly a food revolution has started. I grown up in a culture where we were taught that you get what you pay for from when we were kids and this applies to food like anything else and having a business background, I also know that all businesses needs to make profits to survive. Starting from these two assumptions, it is easy to get to the conclusion that whenever we think we saved some money, we have actually wasted the money we spent. This is truer for the food because everything we eat and drink can harm our health, and even when it does not, they are not a pleasure anymore. "

This is truer for the food because everything we eat and drink can harm our health, and even when it does not, they are not a pleasure anymore. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    All my friends and colleague have heard me saying this, but probably never listened to it, hopefully now, after Jamie Oliver said the same, they will. The only way to really be aware of what we eat is by reading the labels, and even though sometime they are not clear, they definitely help. Often only one extra or less ingredient can make a big difference on the price. Think of the olive oil in jars. If you go to any supermarket, you will see that the jars are made with non extra virgin olive oil, only the premium are and the difference in price is remarkable.  \r\n\
    \r\n\
    But how many people read the labels when shopping? I do, but I guess I am one of the few and this is because it is now part of my being, working in the industry and having grown eating properly by my mum, I want to know what I eat and drink. My dad always says that it is better to drink one glass of a good wine than a whole bottle of a wine that will give you a hangover the following day, because if the wine is good, it won't. This is the background I come from and unconsciously one of the reason I started my business was because I could not find what I was used to eat and drink in the UK. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Behind a bottle of wine or a chicken, there is a lot of work involved but we often don't see it and therefore don't appreciate and don't want to pay for it. But this difference is not only on the price but also on the taste. All TV programs I have seen recently were mainly focusing on the extra cost we should pay if choosing them, but I think they should have had put more emphasis on the extra taste we get. They taste miles better and when you get used to it, there is no way back. It has been mentioned free range eggs. When I was a kid my grandma used to make me, every single morning, 2 or 3 eggs of zabaglione and the eggs she was using were bought from small farmers with a few chickens and it was one of the moments I was looking forward and if I could find the right eggs I will probably do it myself now. It gave me, a kid, all energies and it was healthy. Maybe someone will object this now but I think we moved too far down the line. What I was trying to say is that when she could not find fresh and free range eggs, she used to use older eggs and then as a last resource, supermarket eggs. I can tell you that the taste was nowhere close and every time she used supermarket eggs she used to point out to me the different color intensity of the yolk. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    If we can't read the label, taste the difference. This is easier and more immediate. One of my clients bought an extra virgin olive oil from us, he loves dipping his bread in olive oil, and he told me that he used to buy the most expensive extra virgin olive oil of the Asda brand before. After he bought the oil, he went home and did one thing. He tasted the two oils one next to the other and he told me that he had never tasted olive oil before. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The last thing I want to say is that all supermarkets are the same. There is not a good and a bad one. What is coming out from these programs is that all supermarkets put profit first. The difference is that there are supermarkets that admit it and supermarkets that don't. I wasn't surprised at all when I heard that the Co-op which advertise itself as an ethical supermarket initially refused to take into consideration the adoption of free range chickens or that words like ethical, fair trade etc are only used to attract customers through the door. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The advice I am giving you is to taste the difference. Better a glass of a good wine than not a whole bottle of bad wine. "

  description: "I believe that education could be the solution of many problems, including wine related ones. I have discovered wine when I was only 2 years old, I was taught to appreciate and enjoy it but was also made aware of the problems it can give. I love wine, I enjoy it but don't abuse. The best way to start this education process is by knowing what is inside a bottle of wine. I tested Italian wines because this is what I know. Before we get to the point of this post, when reading the label of any Italian wine, if the label says Imbottigliato da, it means bottle by and this is used when the bottler does not correspond with the grape grower. When it does, the word imbottigliato is followed by another couple of words, an example is all'origine. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    A couple of days ago I have decided to visit all major supermarkets, Asda, Tesco, Mark & Spencer, Morrison and Sainsbury to read the labels, or better the back labels,  of their own labels and cheap Italian wines. If you have been following me on my blog, in many occasions I said that the Italian wine industry is characterised by lots of small vineries so my starting assumption was that wines from different supermarkets were all made by the same big ones. I started my discovery journey at Tesco, I have visited the Newcastle branches of each supermarket, and discovered that their suppliers were PI Spa, CAGI Spa, Martini, Cantina di soave, Equipe srl, Casa Girelli, Piccini. Another discovery I made is that many wines did not have any name but only a code identifying the bottler. This is perfectly legal, however, it is done when one of the party wants to hide itself. In this occasion I did not write down the codes and compare them with the others, but I am certain will confirm the findings. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I then moved to the next supermarket, Mark & Spencer, and seen that plenty of their wines, including their so called house wine, are made by two main companies, Casa Girelli and AVP SCA. Then it was the turn of Morrison where their main Italian wine suppliers were Cavit, Settesoli, Piccini (here they were using a different name on the label, Villa Gemma), Cantina Due Palme (again, using a different label) and Pasqua. Then it was the time of Sainsbury, where the main suppliers were Piccini, Cecchi, Cantina 2 Palme, Ascheri, Giv, Casa girelli, Araldica, Sartori. Lastly, it was time for Asda where the main suppliers were Cecchi, Settesoli, Casa girelli, Araldica, Casama, Equipe Srl. The ones above are only the companies behind the supermarket's own label and cheap Italian wines.  All supermarkets had, in different quantity, good Italian wines but their prices was not cheap at all. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    First conclusion, as we can all see, is that many names appear amongst the suppliers of more than one supermarket, I have also found that a few of them uses different brands for different supermarkets but I am confident that there is no difference in how the wines taste. Some of the companies found, are real wine makers, but the same wine with their name on the labels is at least 2 or 3 times more expensive, this should already tell us a lot about the wine we are buying. I have also found a couple of suppliers of which I had never heard of before, and I know the Italian wine industry and how to use google, I am pretty sure they are not wine makers but brokers, bottling supermarkets' own label  wines at their required cost. I have written many times about that cheap and quality for wine, especially Italian, do not go together and this is another way of saying it. \r\n"

    Here we are, once again, is harvesting time. To be completely honest, the harvest has started around the 15th of August for the white wines in the southern regions whilst the red wines and the northern regions are starting now and will finish toward the end of September. The first thing to say about the 2008 vintage is that Italy will be, for the first time, the biggest producers of wine, overtaking France which due to non favourably weather conditions, should have one of the worst vintages in the last 10 years according to their Agricultural Ministry. 
    
    Not only the quantity of wine produced has increased, but also the quality has improved with more than 60% of the grapes used in the production of DOCG, DOC and IGT wines. Amongst the regions, Veneto, Apulia, Emilia Romagna and Sicily will this year produce 2/3 of the total production. However, adverse weather conditions in the North West, including Piedmont and Lombardy, will mean that the vintage for these regions, will not be as good as the previous one. 
    
    To fully assess the quality of the 2008 vintage we will need to wait a bit longer, until the harvesting is completed, because it is still too early to check if the heavy rain that have hit the northern regions in the second week of July has made any damage. The 2008 vintage has split Italy in 2 areas, the north and the centre/south, where in the first area the production has decreased due to adverse weather conditions that are still continuing whilst in the second area, the production has increased due to very favourable weather conditions that in some area has determined an anticipated harvesting. 
    
    So, in conclusion, what to expect from the 2008 vintage. It should be a pretty good vintage with very good wines for the regions that have not been hit by the bad weather and not a good vintage for wines from Piedmont and in particular Barolo and Barbaresco. The final assessment of the vintage for these wines has not been made yet and the harvesting has not started yet but at the moment is not looking good. The white wines, generally speaking, should present an aromatic and intense nose whilst the red wines should be very structured. http://www.blogcatalog.com/directory/food_drink/wine

  description: "We keep watching on TV programs about what is behind the food available from supermarkets, but very often, the attention is not on the taste but on other elements that could be the way the lamb or chicken are treated or where it comes from. I think the real difference is in the taste and only at this point, when we tasted the good stuff, I bet everything that we will then start buying without worrying too much about the cost. As my dad would say, it is better a glass of a good wine than not three bottles of a bad one. To start tasting the difference, we don't need to go far or spend a lot of money. We can start from the orange juice we drink for breakfast. Let's buy the most expensive juice available from the supermarket and then press 4 oranges. The juice made by ourselves is miles better than the one bought. Is it a bit more expensive? Who really cares Is the difference in taste worth whatever it cost more? Yes, it is. This is a very simple test. And this applies to everything. And if you don't like making your own juice, then buy any food from a supermarket and read the label, you will read plenty of ingredients that you never heard of and you have no idea what they are. Buy the same food from a small producer and you will recognise all ingredients. \r\n\
    Supermarkets, for many reasons within the definition of supermarket itself, cannot offer you the same quality in food that you can expect buying food made by a small producers. No matter how much they commit themselves, they will never be able to do it. \r\n"

  description: "Unfortunately yesterday was a bad day for rose' wine lovers. The EU has approved a law that allows rose' wine to be made mixing white and red wine raising plenty of critics from plenty of wine makers, especially Italian and French. It is worth to mention that if the law has just been approved in Europe, other countries including Australia and South Africa are already using this method. Currently rose' wine in Europe is made fermenting the juice with the skins at a low temperature for a few hours until the wanted rose' gradient is obtained. This process takes time and skills. With the new method, anyone can make a rose' wine and I am sure there will be plenty of new roses appearing in the coming weeks. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    At Italyabroad.com, together with our wine makers, we completely disagree with this new law. Quantity and price prevail on quality and, proper wine drinkers, people like us who enjoy their glass of wine, are once again the ones that will be losing out. Not only wines made this way will be cheaper, at the moment it is not yet clear whether the wine should have something on the label saying how it is made, but this, I am sure, will become a way to recycle undrinkable or nearly gone red and white wines into rose' wines, so don't wonder if you see an invasion of very cheap rose' wine in the near future. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    And this is a sad time also because the French government has announced that has banned drinking outside, not even in restaurant terraces from the 1st of July. This is a step back to many years ago, I was not even born yet, and with it, part of the French culture is also gone. In the last few years, wine has become a demon for the governments around the world, the cause of all problems; because of few that abuse of it, the rest are paying the cost. Let's start doing something about it."

  description: "..but the Brunello is 4 times more expensive. This was in a few words, the review of a Tuscan red on the BBC Good Food Italian magazine by their wine writer. In case you don't know, 90% of all Tuscan red wines are made with Sangiovese, including the Brunello, and saying that a wine is made with Sangiovese is like saying that 90% of Tuscan reds are made with it. Does this mean anything to a wine drinker or even an expert? No. What makes the Brunello is not only the grape, but also the microclimate on the hill in which the town of Montalcino sits and the vineyards are planted, and the DOCG law requirements in terms of yield per hectare and ageing. It is like saying that a wine is made with Bordeaux's grapes but is 10 times cheaper. From a wine writer that writes for the BBC Good Food magazine you would expect more. I do think that sometime we waste our money when buying such wines, whether it is a Brunello or Bordeaux, but this is simply because the wine name does not guarantee the quality of the wine. There is no guarantee of the result when buying a bottle of wine, there are different information to look for to avoid disappointment, but probably the one that can offer more reassurance is the producer. Good producers very rarely put their name on bad wines. "

  description: "Yesterday I went to see one of my clients and he showed me the list of the best Italian wines according to Tim Atkin. The Guardian and The Observer are publishing a wines of the world guide featuring a selection of wines for all major countries that Tim chose according this year performance at the International wine challenge. A couple of days ago, the country featured was Italy. You have read in previous posts what I think about wine competitions and wine writers, but I was very surprised to see the wines on the list and I could not understand the criteria according to which the wines had been selected. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Analysing the list, the first thing that got my attention was that these wines were available from the usual places, with the supermarkets selling 80% of the wines featured, all wine writers seems to shop for their wines at Tesco and like, independent or small shops do not exist for them. In a letter I wrote to a magazine editor asking why they always go shopping to Tesco or Sainsbury, she replied that they had to look for accessible wines <a href =\"http://www.italyabroad.com/The-real-Italian-wine-guide-from-an-insider/show/25-wine-writers-do-you-trust-them\"><font color=\"#CC0000\">(read the letter)</font></a>. The internet has allowed small and independent shops to become widely available and if she was referring to the price factor, a &pound;49.99 bottle of Barolo, is not everyone wine not even if is available from M&S.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And, as this was not enough, I could not figure out the reasons behind the wine chosen. I could not understand why amongst them there was, for example, the Chianti Riserva Piccini which I think, after having tasted hundreds of Chianti Riservas, one of the worst you could drink. Cheap but it is worth less that what it costs. On the same list, we had the Amarone Allegrini, which is a fantastic wine but not what I would call a good value for money and there are plenty of other Amarones as good as the Allegrini at a more reasonable price. Or the Barbaresco Araldica at &pound;8.99, my opinion of this wine is similar to the one of the Chianti, and next to it the Barbaresco Morassino at &pound;22 which on the other side is a good wine. If I did not know anything about wine, I will surely go for the Araldica, why should I pay &pound;13 more for a similar wine, and I could say something for each and every wine on the list. The last wine I want to mention is the Verdicchio Castelli di Jesi Contrada Balciana Saltarelli which I haven't tasted and will do in the next few weeks but what stroke me was the price, &pound;20.25 which is too much for a Verdicchio. Assuming that this wine is aged by the word oak mentioned in the tasting notes, it is still too much. I have tasted plenty of fantastic Verdicchios, aged and not, much cheaper than that. But because the introduction to the list was saying that the selection was based on the results at the International wine challenge, I did a bit of homework. I went to the site of the competition and searched for a few wines, here the results. Amarone Allegrini &pound;43.95, bronze medal. Amarone della Valpolicella Classico \"Vigneti di Osan\" &pound;50 but gold medal, for &pound;7 I would go for the gold Medal, however this is not available from a supermarket. There were other Amarones winner of a bronze medal, half the price of the Allegrini one. Villa Cafaggio Chianti Classico, according to the International wine challenge website, has not won any medal, though there were other Chianti Classicos that had won a medal. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I will finish this posting inviting you to continue the exercise I have started and taste all wines in the list and then let us know what you think. \r\n"

Result: in one competition won the highest award, in the other one not even a mention. Nothing can prove my point better than this. Everyone has a taste and we judge what we drink based on it. So, what I want to say with that is that you are the only judge of your wines and make your own mind based on your personal taste and don't buy wines only because they have been reviewed or awarded and find out the origin of the wine and the producer's philosophy.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I also want to mention another subject. Wine reviews. Many people buy a specific wine only if it has been reviewed by one of the many wine writers. Recently I came across one of them and I was very surprised about what I read. I read about a wine writer recommending the Asti Spumante Martini. Still now, I cannot understand why he put it amongst the other wines that were pretty good. Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against the Asti Spumante but in Italy now we only use it for Christmas boxes, the cheap ones, that contains a bottle of spumante and a panettone or pandoro and I can ensure you, nobody drinks it. Amongst all Spumantes I have tasted, Asti Spumante is probably the worst. There are also plenty of good reviews that introduce the public to wines otherwise unknown but don't take them for granted and also look for the provenance of their wines, you will often see that they come from the major supermarkets and chain. So, once again, read carefully and behind the lines. \r\n"

    \r\n\
    The Cortona area has proved itself in the last few years to be a perfect place to grow Syrah. The Dal Cero family, who has been making wines since the beginning of the Century, headed by the young  and talented oenologist Davide Dal Cero has released the first vintage of their <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/products/syrah-clanis-dal-cero \"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Clanis</font></a>, a wine made with Syrah grown in vineyards located at 280 m above sea level, south facing, with vines aged 16 years or more.\r\n \r\n\
    With a yield of only 1kg per vine, with 5000 plants per hectar and using selected French clones. The grapes are manually harvested and then put through two stages of selection where only the best grapes are chosen. The wine is then aged in French barriques and tonneaux, partly new and partly no, for 16 months. \r\n\
    The result is an outstanding wine, elegant, full bodied. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The bouquet presents initially notes of ripe fruit, plum, blackberry, blackcurrant, and blueberry and successively shows candied fruit, chocolate, vanilla and toasted hazelnut. In the mouth amaze its balance and the great texture and length, indication that the Clanis will develop into a great wine. Presented in a Rhone style bottle, the wine certainly has a lot in common with the best wines of the Northern Rhone. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Produced in very limited quantity, this first vintage is now available "

    \r\n\
    Buy smarter and drink better, this has to be the subject but free to interpret... My main priority will be drink better, I do not mind paying something extra for a good bottle of wine but I will never be happy to pay, even if only a few pennies, for a poor bottle of wine. But how to drink better buying smarter, is this achievable? I would say yes. How, simply don't buy wine by its price, both sides, cheap or expensive. In Italy we have a saying that says cheap is equal poor quality, in Britain I learned it is you get what you pay for, if you are then buying wine, remember to take &pound;1.5 (duty) off the cost to see how much you are actually paying the wine and think how much a bottle of Coke cost. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    On the other side, I will never buy an expensive wine only because is dear and therefore presumed to be good unless I am buying it from a known and trusted merchant or know the wine or the wine maker. I will also avoid a wine simply because its award or points, I have tasted plenty of wines that had plenty of awards or points and remained dissatisfied, points and awards need to put into context, and taste is unique and an award doesn't mean that I will like the wine. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Once eliminated the cheap, the expensive and the awarded, I will choose between the ones in the middle. My approach will be to start eliminating the ones that looks like made on demand, read the label, back and front, of the ones left and then pick one. Drink better is not only about drinking better wines but also drinking differently, tasting different wines and wine makers, and not be afraid of picking the wrong wine, sometime drinking a bad wine teach more than a book full of words. \r\n"

  description: "Last night, like many other people, I watched Dispatches on Channel 4 and if before watching it I thought that they would have brought some truth and light about the wine industry, at the end of the program I realised that they only damaged a few producers and brands.  Whilst I think some of what it was said in the program it is true, what I think the program did not show was the whole picture and precisely the reason why the producers are doing what they are doing and the quality of the wine not being what it should be. And if the reason behind the program as was said was to prove the necessity for a wine label containing all ingredients used in making the wine, some of the ingredients mentioned on Tv, even with a proper label, would never appear because they are against the law.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I did not like the program and did not find it objective since they only investigated and showed a part of what the real problem is, because this wine is going somewhere and someone is buying it to then be able to resell it at cheap price and compete unfairly with honest wine makers. Last week I was very surprised to see in a supermarket bottles of wines at &pound;2 (for consumers who does not know, of those &pound;2, &pound;1,70 is VAT and Duty, so the real cost of the wine is &pound;0.30, less than a bottle of mineral water, with the producer and the supermarket's profit included ) signed by the supermarket's Master of Wine on the back. I will never buy such wine, but unfortunately not all people think like me since there were only a few bottles left on the shelves and this is what I think the real problem is, big buyers such as supermarkets, are driving the prices to the floor. Why don't we create another fair trade label for poor first world wine makers that are exploited by these big buyers? And on the other side, selling the wine at &pound;2 per bottle, does not fuel the binge drinking? Many questions should have been answered by the program. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I was also surprised by what Miss Jancis Robinson MW said during the interview. She said that the wine industry has become industrialised, but I have rarely seen in any of her or her colleagues' wine reviews on our Sunday papers a wine that was not coming from supermarkets made by big producers, including the champagnes that were showed on TV. If she does not want the wine making to become another factory, why her and her colleagues don't do anything to push and promote wines made by proper, independent wine makers and not bottling companies, why don't they boycott these wines? Why a master of wine is putting her name on the back of a wine I am very confident she will never drink (the &pound;2 bottle)? They could help the cause and make a difference.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The program should have gone beyond the single cases, analysed the whole industry, in this case they would have done a fantastic job to promote good and healthy wine drinking and not using a couple of examples as the reason to have a full ingredients list on the bottle of wine when, even if they were to win their battle, what they found would have never been put on the label.\r\n"

  description_short: Another year, another Vinitaly. Last year the event coincided with the Brunello scandal and all attention was for the wine makers involved, luckily, this year, we were back to business even though in a more sober way. The 2009 has not started very well for the wine industry and exhibitors at the Vinitaly were expecting less visitors and I have to say that, to me, there were; however, numbers released by the organizers were showing more visitors than ever.

The 2009 has not started very well for the wine industry and exhibitors at the Vinitaly were expecting less visitors and I have to say that, to me, there were; however, numbers released by the organizers were showing more visitors than ever. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Vinitaly is always a fantastic event to catch up with producers already known to taste new wines and vintages but also to discover new wines. Currently, the Italian wine industry is experiencing a renaissance, rediscovering grapes once lost or unknown outside the area, and making wines reflecting the terroir and the characteristics of the grapes. After the tendency of the last few years, where all Italian wine makers were trying to, to fight the competition from new world wineries, imitate new world wines style, have finally realised that if Italy is going to win the battle is not imitating but creating, using the countless native grapes and the skills in making wine that no other country has.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Another positive surprise, this trend started several years ago, is that the overall quality of Italian wine is improving a lot. As I was discussing with a couple of colleagues during the event, a lot of wine makers, mainly small family run wineries,  are now producing good wine benefiting the whole Italian wine industry, still only few makes outstanding wines, but sometime the difference between good and outstanding is not obvious for the non expert wine drinker. On the opposite side, we have famous names that are moving more and more towards becoming factory of wine with a very few exceptions but very expensive and, big companies or cantine sociali that are still producing very poor quality wines intended for cost driven wine consumers that, in the UK, are often the ones on offer from supermarkets and very little, in this regard is done by Italian agencies created to protect the Italian wine reputation. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Apart from these general considerations, my Vinitaly has been, as usual, very busy and I have been running for the whole of my stay from one stand to another. Not only I spent sometime with all our producers, but I have also tasted several new wines and I am working on bringing them to the UK wine lovers. I am now working on my notes and will publish several posts about my Vinitaly, so if you want to know what I did, come back soon. A presto"

  description: "Last Sunday I was invited to a Birthday in a restaurant, we had delicious food and pretty good wines, however, the wine list was poorly made, we had to opt for the most expensive wines on it. At the end of the long lunch, we finished at 5pm, because we did not want to go home yet, we decided to stop for another few minutes in the restaurant bar. The boys had a glass of wine and the girls that were driving, had soft drinks. We had a look at the wine list again and did not have enough choice so we went for their house wine, however, the wine was undrinkable. After the first sip, we left the wine in the glass and left. The wine was very poor, had too much acidity and no flavour at all. This final glass of wine, or better, its poor quality, changed our opinion on the whole restaurant experience. We went from being very happy, we will come back soon to a sort of it was all right, we may come back. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The house wine in a restaurant should be seen as the wine that can pretty much, pair the majority of dishes on the menu and not as the cheapest wine. Unfortunately, on both sides, it is wrongly misinterpreted. Both sides, in the vast majority, see it as the cheapest wine; for the restaurant the less they can pay for it the better is, for the diners the low priced wine on the list. A house wine, like any other wine, should be good and balanced but what often happens is that house wines are not, and the only component that stands out is the body. Many diners though, see this body as an indication of the quality of the wine, even if this is not the case. The body of the wine is a component and should be seen into context and non on its own. I personally, unless I know it, never order a house wine in the restaurant, often with only a few pounds more you can get a much better wine, however, if I am forced to choose one, I will be looking for all different elements, a nice and persistent nose, full of flavour in the mouth with the body blending perfectly into it.

  description: "I constantly receive plenty of emails from wine sellers, I guess the moment someone notices that I import and sell wine, they see me as a potential buyer and therefore add my name to their mailing list and I receive emails from all over the world, not only UK based businesses.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    However, these emails have one thing in common, they always include wine critics' rating and better than that, they use the ratings to sell the wine. All they say is the name of the wine and the rating, mentioning only the highest. For a few wines, as an exercise, I searched for wine critics' ratings and found that not all wine critics gave the same rating to the wines and the wine seller only reported the ones who rated the wine the most choosing one or the other according to the rating given but the real question here is what is the value of a rating for the wine drinker.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Wine critics can play an important role, offering information that will not be otherwise available and at the same time, can make the world to discover new regions and producers however, simply tasting a few highly rated wines from the same critic, we can guess the critic's preferences and therefore see that their ratings are influenced by their palate. And not all wine critics think the same, there are plenty of cases were wine critics disagree on rating a vintage or a wine. Still, wine consumers do buy highly rated wines otherwise they will not be given so much importance. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Is a high rated wine a safe purchase? Are we going to like the wine simply because it was given 90 point? Do we like an artist simply because the critics love him/her ? No, this is the answer. But whilst for the artist we are happy to say what we think, for the wine, we don't, we are afraid of saying our opinion when different from the wine critic's one. Why?  And what is the difference for a wine drinker between an 88 point and a 90 point wine? The rating will never tell us whether we like a wine or not and will never be a safe purchase and the two points difference that makes such a big difference in the critics' wine world, for a normal wine drinker are irrilevant. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ratings are given based on a tasting in a specific day, under certain circumstances, in a certain mood, amongst certain wines. If we change any of the above, the result will likely to be different. Selling wines by their rate is an easy way of selling wine, we can all do that, we don't need any knowledge or skills, and we will all be selling the same wines and many of the email I receive do, with the only difference being the price but an highly rated wine normally brings an inflated price. Also, plenty of fantastic wines never get to be tasted by wine critics and if we only be drinking the highly rated wines, we will stop enjoying wine and will all have lost something.  Wine retailers should not rely too much on wine critics, they should do their bit to promote wine and educate wine consumers selling unknown and unrated wines. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Wine consumers should listen, read but then buy the wines they like and not the ones that someone else does. \r\n"

  description: "A couple of days ago I have received a call from the manager of one of the restaurants we supply complaining about one of the wines we supply them with. It took me a few minutes to understand that the complaint was not about the wines itself, but was about the label. There was nothing wrong with the wine but simply the manager thought that because of the label the wine would not sell. I have to precise that the label has nothing wrong, it is simply the combination of a classic wine and a small producer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This call left me speechless and shocked and the only thing I could say was that if he was not happy about the label I would have arranged for the wine to be taken back. I was also amazed to hear that the manager was happy to pay a bit more for a better label, without even taking into consideration what was inside the bottle. After the conversation, I agreed to take the wine back, I started thinking about the call and I felt disappointed, because, if restaurants, start buying wines by the label, it will be the end of wine as I know it. Restaurants are supposedly the place where customers are guided in their wine purchases and don't look at the label when choosing the wine. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Spending many hours on the road and eating often out, I know that this is not the only case, it is probably the first one that happened to me. I see plenty of restaurants serving plenty of good looking, poor quality, wines and whilst supermarkets that sell plenty of wine by the label, are now starting to stock normal label wines on the shelves to deceive their customers, giving the impression that they are buying a small production wine, restaurants are now going the other direction. \r\n\

    Good looking labels are not the only case where wine is not sold for its quality. A classic example is the Pinot Grigio. Pinot Grigio is currently the most sold wine and every restaurant has at least one on its wine list, however, many restaurants are selling Pinot Grigio blends that have the only reason in making a cheaper wine, because the other grape is cheaper than the Pinot grigio one, examples are Pinot grigio/cataratto and Pinot grigio/garganega. These wine are not available in Italy and only made for export. "

  description: "If it sound like a bargain, read this post first. A couple of days ago I went to the local Tesco and walking across the aisles I noticed plenty of people buying cases of one of the wines on offer. I got closer and seen that the wine was a Pinot Grigio reduced from &pound;7.99 to &pound;3.99. I don't buy wines from supermarkets but because all those people were buying it, I thought of getting a bottle to see if it was a real bargain. I read the label and immediately noticed that it was bottled by Martini, the same of the Martini we all know, and did not have any vintage on it. This let me very suspicious. A wine such as the Pinot Grigio, without vintage is very unusual, if not rare, and the only reason I could think of was that the wine was not a recent vintage or maybe different vintages together that had not been sold and needed to make room for the 2009 vintage. Nevertheless, even if I would have never bought such a wine, I decided to go for it. Bought the bottle, took it home and here we were, me and my bottle of Tesco's &pound;7.99 reduced to &pound;3.99 Pinot Grigio Lenoti.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I was very curious. I opened the bottle, the temperature was right for the tasting, to appreciate the aromas and flavours of a white wine it needs to be tasted at a warmer temperature, not straight off the fridge. Poured the wine in the glass and started. The colour was what I was expecting, however, the wine had a very feeble nose with some fruit but not much left and did not stay in the glass for long; in the mouth, there was no wine left, it had no acidity and no flavour, it was definitely not a 2008 vintage, it may was a poor made 2007 vintage. After the sip, I threw the rest of the bottle in the sink. As someone once told me to describe a wine he had drunk, it was not even good for my dog. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Now, nobody expect to buy a decent bottle of wine for &pound;3.99 and we all know that most of the time, when we see big discounts on wine, we are being ripped off, but a lot of people were buying cases of it simply because it once was a &pound;7.99 Pinot Grigio. I had never seen this wine before so I am not too sure where they had it for that price, but even if Tesco has had the wine at &pound;7.99 for 28 days as prescribed by law to then reduce the price, it was ripping its customers before and now because the wine is not even worth &pound;3.99. \r\n"

  description: "Bob Tyrer, in an article published on the <a href=\" http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/wine/article6008476.ece \"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Times </font></a> wrote that the best prosecco needs no peaches to outshine champagne at twice the price (he has chosen our <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/product-search?text=prosecco\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Prosecco </font></a> as his favourite if you did not know) so imagine what a good Franciacorta can do. Franciacorta is the Italian for Champagne, a sparkling wine made using the classic method, with the second fermentation in the bottle. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I love the bollicine, Italian for sparkling wines, because amongst other things, are wines that complement a wide variety of dishes, from starter to desserts and can also be served as an aperitif, so take you all the way from start to finish. I was recently given a bottle of Champagne, the Lanson Black Label, a champagne costing about &pound;25 per bottle. Sunday, as every other Sunday, we open our bottle of bollicine and we would have opened a Franciacorta if we did not have the Champagne. I don't think I ever had a bottle of Lanson before, had plenty of other champagnes, so was not sure what to expect. I opened the wine, poured it in the glass and the first disappointment. It had a very weak nose and there were no sign of the toast, bread, patisseries aromas that I was expecting. All it had was a feeble fruity nose with green apples. In the mouth, the acidity, well too much, covered everything else, with none of the structure and richness that you would expect from a Champagne.  Someone could suggest that it needed time but I don't think so, there was nothing to balance it. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    We only had a sip and decided to throw the rest of the champagne in the sink. After this very disappointing experience, we opened a bottle of Franciacorta and what an experience. For the same price, what a better wine. All you expect from a proper champagne. Franciacorta wines are made using Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero grapes grown in the Brescia province, with a yield per hectare of 100 ql against the 120-144 ql of the Champagne and a minimum ageing of 18 months against the 15 months of the champagne. Using Bob Tyrer words, a good Franciacorta can outshine Champagne at twice the price.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While I was looking on the internet for the tasting notes prepared by Lanson to see what I should have drunk, I have also noticed that all websites selling the champagne, from Tesco to Waitrose to independents, have the same tasting notes; it appears that all Master of Wines and importers never actually tasted the wine or if they did, they thought it was better to use the producer's notes to sell the wine.\r\n"

  description: "The magazine Which has recently published the result of a survey about supermarkets' promotions and the result were, for me, not surprising. What they found is that in plenty of cases, if not in all, the real discount was always different from the one highlighted. They have found that wines advertised as discounted by 50% were not at all discounted or discounted a lot less. What they did was to take the price of the wine the week before the promotions and then again, the reduced price and compare the two and the reality was that often, the price before the promotion and the price during the promotion were the same so no discount had been made and the promotions were only used to entail customers. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Wine and healthy food are possibly the only two products where economies of scale applies only to a very limited extent. Wine is made with grapes and grapes are grown in the vineyards, not produced in a factory, and needs to be looked after for one year. If, then we add, that each bottle of wine carries duty for nearly &pound;1.5 and VAT, we can easily see that a bottle of wine is often cheaper than a bottle of coke which is made in a factory from a formula that does not require any human intervention if not in bottling it. During my wine tasting courses I always get asked two questions. The first is how the grapes can be different. Assuming that all other conditions in which the grapes are grown are the same, each vine can produce more or less grapes depending on the pruning. Obviously the more buds the more fruit and ultimately less quality. On the other side, less buds, less fruit, better quality. The second implies a better and more expensive wine. Another elements that determine a better wine, is the harvesting. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Not all grapes get to full ripeness at the same time and this even happens for grapes within the same vineyards, and they should be harvested at different time, however, machine harvesting and big producers do not do it, cannot afford to wait. A harvesting so made will produce a lower quality wine, but cheaper. Economies of scale, bigger purchasing power and lower prices, can only be applied to the bottles and closures which have a limited impact on the cost of the wine. So, if the wine is cheap is due to its quality and not because a supermarket or producers can buy big. If you don't believe me, try and see for yourself. Buy a bottle of cheap wine and another of a more expensive wine. If you think that the cheaper is better or the same than the other, please let me know the name of the wines.  \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I need to expand this last statement I made. Our philosophy has always been to import small producers because they offer better value for money, so, if we were drinking one of our wine with one from a trustworthy name, our wine will be at least as good as the other, at a cheaper price. When above I said cheaper, I meant those wines that are sold for a few pounds or discounted by 50%, a decent wine cannot cost less that &pound;6. Another reason behind supermarket cheaper wines, is the vintage. Often, for vintage wines, they sell poor vintages, vintages that more conscientious producers have skipped or wines that have long gone these are only few of the reasons behind cheap wines, so nobody is giving anything for free and if it sounds too good to be true, probably it is.

  description: "Following my previous<a href= http://www.italyabroad.com/The-real-Italian-wine-guide-from-an-insider/show/50-vinitaly-2009-and-italian-wine\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> post</font></a>,my vinitaly started on Friday when I have visited my producers, tasting new wines and new vintages. I don't want to bore you with the details, but I want you to tell you a couple of highlights from my producers. The first one comes from Dal Cero. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Dal Cero family has vineyards in Tuscany, in Cortona, and Veneto, near Soave, and this year they presented three new wines, a Pinot Grigio Blush and a Sangiovese Rose', and a Syrah. The overall quality of Dal Cero wines are remarkable, however, I was very impressed with their Sirah, the wine is called Clanis from the latin name of the Chiana's valley where the vineyards are located. A preamble about Syrah and Tuscany has to be made here. The soil of the vineyards around Cortona is proving an ideal soil in which to plant the Syrah grape. Said that, the beauty of the Dal Cero Sirah is that is different from all other Syrah wines of the area because it counter the elegance to the power and in fact, when I tasted the wine, my mind went immediately to France, to the elegance and class of the Cote du Rhone wines' or the Chateauneuf du Pape, very different from all the others where the power is privileged on the elegance. If I did not know that it was from Tuscany, I would have thought of tasting a French Syrah, a very elegant wine, still not ready, but with all the characteristics to develop into something sublime. Unfortunately they haven't released the wine yet and told me that could only give me a few cases because they have a very limited production and I look forward to when it will be released. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The other highlight is the Pomedes from Scubla. Roberto Scubla is a wine maker from Friuli, the Colli Orientali area, and makes outstanding wines and it is one of those, unfortunately not many,  that you could listen for days without getting bored. I always look forward whenever I am meeting him and this year, I was happy to taste a Pomedes, a blend of Pinot Bianco, Friulano (the new name for Tocai Friulano) and Reisling Renano the way I like it with plenty of personality and towards the old style Pomedes. The first time I tasted Scubla wines was in 2003 and was really impressed with the Pomedes, a wine that could stand a Grand Cru Chablis, a wine that would really impress, a wine with a unique personality, a wine that needed to be understood. However, Roberto made the choice of making wine easier to understand, still retaining their uniqueness and making outstanding wines. I have already said that many makes good wines and few outstanding, Roberto Scubla is one of them. I have to admit that initially I did not like the choice too much but the result was still there. However, the new vintage, brought back the mad side of the wine, I went back to the origin, and I love it. During our meeting I told him that and that whilst the previous vintages were bending over towards wine drinkers, this one requires wine drinkers to bend over it, what I am saying is that the new vintage is a wine with personality and like all such wines needs to be understood to be appreciated. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I was also very pleased and surprised with the other producers and I could also notice in the wines the difference between last year and this year vintages and the difference between 2008 vintage in the north and the south due to different weather conditions, with the south having good weather conditions all the way up to the vintage and the north where the weather has had its up and down, making the vintage more difficult but still achieving very good results. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    After having finished visiting my producers, I decided to spend the rest of the Vinitaly tasting new wines and I have focused my attention to two wines, The Gavi and the Franciacorta. The Gavi is made with a grape called Cortese grown in vineyards surrounding the town of Gavi and other 58 towns. Franciacorta, on the other side, is a sparkling wine made using the classic method with the second fermentation in the bottle, the same used for the Champagne using Pinot Nero, Chardonnay and Pinot Bianco, both having the DOCG status. Franciacorta producers and wines are enjoying good times, both in Italy and abroad, especially now where Champagne is losing its appeal, Franciacorta offers better value for money, however, many producers are riding the wave so the difficulty now is to find a good one that still offers good value for money.

Because Chardonnay is a white grape and a rose' wine cannot be made with just Chardonnay, curious, I read the back label and found out that it is a Chardonnay with added Merlot. A couple of days earlier, when shopping at Sainsbury I have noticed a white wine, a Sauvignon, on offer, again in prominent position and discounted by 50% saying on the label Gran Reserva. Again, curious, I took the bottle and read front and back label only to discover that the wine is a 2009 Sauvignon and the gran reserva is not due to ageing.  I have also noticed that amongst the wines on offer, this was the most sold. In the old world, a wine could only have gran reserva on the label if it had been aged. In another occasion, I saw a wine on offer, an Italian sparkling wine, again, in special offer, highly discounted, with a wine award winner label on the neck of the bottle and customers were buying it. It was an Asti Spumante that in Italy nobody would dare to buy, unless you were buying it for your worst enemy or as a joke. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    To me, these wines and the way are presented, shows a clear marketing strategy more and more often used by supermarkets to mislead and deceive consumers. A missing information, an extra word with a confusing meaning or an award to entice customers towards highly discounted wines that have been proved by plenty of reliable sources, being offered at what will be their normal price.  And the first two episodes are also what I call tricks, used by wine makers based on, or not, suggestions by the supermarket. If this was not the case, why any blend that has Pinot Grigio on it, even in small quantities, due to the popularity of the wine, has the mention of the grape on the label and the Chardonnay did not? Or what, a non expert wine drinker, will think when he or she reads gran reserva on the label of a wine reduced by 50%? That is getting a bargain. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Unfortunately all these tricks, all legally ok, but not ethically, have the only aim of deceiving consumers and keeping them away from good wine and there is no one who can help, other than the consumers themselves, reading the whole label.\r\n"

Our Christmas celebrations start on the 24th and finish on the 26th of December and during these3 days, with plenty of food and wine and we will rarely leave the table, it will be a three days eating marathon. The menu will be different from region to region, from city to city and even from village to village, but a few ingredients will be uniting Italy, the panettone or pandoro, the spumante and the torrone, they will be on every Italian table. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The wines, together with the food, will vary depending on where we are and they will tend to be local wines. Italian wines are made to match the food and each menu will feature local food matched by local wines. The wines I will be drinking with my family, in Italy, will be the Prosecco to accompany my mum's appetisers, The Pomedes with the lasagne and the Barolo with the lamb. To finish, plenty of Spumante with the Panettone and the other local biscuits my mum will make. I guess my dinner will be somewhat of different, because I will match Abruzzean dishes with foreigner wines \r\n\
    \r\n\
    A couple of days ago I have received a copy of the magazine Taste Italia. If you remember I have already written about it previously because they were only featuring wines from supermarkets and I had written an email to the editor asking why. The response I had, you can click <a href=\"http://www.italyabroad.com/The-real-Italian-wine-guide-from-an-insider/show/21-italian-wines-on-the-press-incorrect-information\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">here</font></a> if you want to read it, was that the reason behind their choices was to review easy to access wines. With the internet and us shopping online, everything is accessible now, so the response did not stand out. I also want to mention that the editor promised she was going to publish my letter and this has never been done. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Following my letter, I noticed that suddenly, their wine writer left, or at least his name is not mentioned anymore. If before Brian St Pierre had his name and photograph on the wine page, now there is no mention of who review the wines. So, apparently my letter, something did. However, no change of approach has been taken with regard to the wines with the majority of wines still being sourced from supermarkets with the odd good one sourced elsewhere but without any logic. On the last issue they put on the same page a &pound;3.62 Soave Classico, I invite everyone to buy and drink it, and a &pound;13.75 Tocai Friulano which is good wine but does not offer good value for money. At least, when Brian St Pierre was running the wine section, the wines were from supermarkets, the usual Italian wines, but at least were good ones. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    On the following page, this month they have reviewed panettone. Again, all panettones are the ones available from supermarkets and the only one really made in Italy is obviously the editor choice, what a difficult choice. However, if you type panettone on google you will get plenty of handmade panettones imported by companies like Italyabroad.com that are miles better than the ones reviewed. I am Italian and I think that the people behind the magazine running the wine and food section, have no idea of what Italy really offer and should go the extra mile to find something unknown, not the obvious.  We have a fabulous wine and food tradition, with thousand of small producers, and the best Taste Italia can do is to go shopping in supermarkets. Boycott Taste Italia magazine if you are a lover of Italian food and wine. \r\n"

  description: "Germany will now be able to bottle their own prosecco, using grapes grown in Italy. A recent sentence from the German court ruled that sparkling wine produced in Germany using Italian Prosecco grapes can be labelled as Italian. The sentence is based on the fact that the grapes imported in Germany are from Italy and therefore, according to the Italian law, respect the IGT (indicazione geografica tipica) requirements and the place where the sparkling wine is made has no relevance. The difference on the label between the German and Italian prosecco will be the IGT denomination on the label. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    And whilst Italian prosecco producers have finally won their battle, the prosecco can now be DOCG (only the valdobbiadene and colli asolani area) if the producers want it, otherwise DOC, with the IGT denomination disappearing from the labels. The main difference, a part from the fact that a DOC or DOCG cannot be bottled outside the area and Germany or any other country even buying grapes from Italy will not be able to call it Prosecco DOCG, the main difference is in the yield, that goes from 250 q/h to 170 for the DOC and 130 for the DOCG and this difference will be tastable  without being an expert.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Prosecco DOC can only be produced in 7 provinces, between Veneto and Friuli, including the province of Trieste where the town of Prosecco from which the grape is believed to have originated is to be found. Prosecco is produced using the Charmat method, in which the secondary fermentation takes place in tanks."

  description: "I have just got an email from a producer I met a couple of weeks ago at the Vinitaly all excited about Parkers reviews of its wines. When I tasted its wines, I wasn't really impressed by them, nothing wrong with the wines themselves, but this producer was releasing its wines so late that this had implications both on the characteristics of the wines, aromas and flavours, and on the drinkability. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Due to the very late release, the time spent in the bottle would reduce its drinkability period and, when I tasted them, I found some lasting less than a year after their release, I was tasting a dead wine, if a wine can be dead. The wines had a vertical fall and had nothing left on them, in fact, the producer confirmed to me that they had to recall the remaining bottles. I then tasted the next vintage and, even though they had not been released yet, you could already see that the wine was ready, and Parker agrees with me on that because he says that they can be drunk starting from 2009 but I invite him to try the wines again in one year time and see whether they are gone or can last until 2012 as he says, because I am sure he has only tasted one vintage so it does not know how the wines evolve. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Another reason I was not impressed with the wines was because this way of making them, was yes, emphasising certain traits, but they were different from the ones I was expecting, I found them pretty Parker style I guess, I cannot think of a better word. The characteristics emphasised were the vegetal, mature, super ripe fruits as Parker calls them, jam, oak, and the wines were full, rich, too much, and you don't expect and want them this way. This is my opinion about these wines, I had already decided not to import them, and I am not changing my mind simply because Parker says that they are good but I am sure that there will be plenty of others doing that, I guess this is what set uu apart from the rest. Specialising in Italian wines I never had the chance to taste the same wines at the same time than Parker, but this episode tells me a lot about how wines are tasted and scored and no person should be allowed to determine the success of failure of a wine this way, this is not fair for the wine maker.

  description: "A couple of days ago I was shopping at M&S and when walking along the wine aisle I noticed that they were selling amongst others, a wine called Corvina at &pound;6.99 and a Valpolicella Ripasso at &pound;5.99. When looking at it, I also seen that on the same shelf there was a Nebbiolo d'Alba at &pound;10.99 and a Barbaresco at &pound;9.99.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For many shoppers, these wines look completely different and the price does not say anything, however, these are wines of the same family. Corvina is one of the grapes used in the making of the Valpolicella and the lot, Amarone, Valpolicella Ripasso etc. and Nebbiolo, on the other side, is the grape used in the making of the Barbaresco and the Barolo and the price tells me a lot. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Both wines, Barbaresco and Ripasso should be a lot more costly than their young brothers, simply because they should be made using better grapes, following a more complex wine making process and for the Barbaresco, aged in barrels as well. The fact that they are not, tells me that the quality of these wines is not good. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, each wine has its own cost, a minimum price that guarantees the quality. If the price is below the cost, it is better to stay away from it and drink something else.\r\n"

  description: "Recently I keep reading about the growth of the rose' wine and the fall of the red wine and none of the articles read tries to explain the reason. My explanation for this growth is the age of the UK market. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    We don't need to forget that wine in the UK is still something relatively new compared to what is in Italy and France, in these last two countries the consumption of rose' wines is very limited, and rose' wine comes just before the red wine. It is a bit more structured than the wine white but less than the red wine and I see this growth as a natural evolution towards the red wine. The more the UK market becomes mature, the more the consumption of red wine will increase. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Other reasons I see behind this growth are the fact that the red wine is more a foodie wine whilst in the UK the wine is often drunk outside meals and this makes the rose' more suitable than the red and, lastly, the cost that makes rose' wines, in the low end of the price gap, better value for money. I also want to share a wine maker tip that explains why rose' wines are perceived as better. The cold covers smells and problems of the wine whilst the right temperature enhances the bouquet and the cleanliness of it. Similarly, the oak flavour can be used to cover the same problems in red or white wines. "

    In the last few months things have made a turn which is not good for first-class, hand produced, good value for money wine, and is making, cheap, mass produced, wine winning: the decrease in value of the sterling. Currently the sterling is nearly equal to the euro which means that European wines have suddenly, without any reason, gone up because of the exchange rate and this has not been counterbalanced by any reduction in duty which was lastly increased on the 1st of December 2008. At the moment, for a &pound;3 bottle of wine we are paying &pound;2 of taxes and with 1 euro/sterling people from the continent cannot get a bottle of wine. In the UK we can, we import all their cheapest wine, how lucky we are \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Talking about something more interesting, for the second year in a row, I spent my Christmas holiday in Trentino, last year I went to Alto Adige (the more German part) and I can ensure you it has been another fantastic holiday with plenty of wine discoveries, will tell you a bit more in the coming weeks. \r\n\

  description: "Italyabroad.com brings to the UK the first wine completely sulphite-free, accordingly to the chemical analysis performed by an Italian laboratory, the wine does not contain any traces of SO2. The wine is the 2007 <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/products/show/organic-merlot-sulphite-free-coceani\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Merlot</a></font> from Coceani.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    There are two sources of sulphites for the wine: one is natural and the other one, in the form of sulphur dioxide (SO2), is added during the wine process. Natural sulphites are naturally produced during the fermentation of the wine whilst the added sulphites are added to the wine to protect it from unwanted oxidations and are important for the conservation of the wine. SO2 is considered to be harmless at the levels typically found in wine, but when the quantity of SO2 is higher or in case of asthmatics or allergics, can create problems and give headaches.  It is worth mentioning that sulphites are not only present in wine, plenty of food and other beverages contains them, specifically all those that mention in the ingredients list codes between E220 and E228. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    So, whilst sulphites can not be added, the only way to reduce the natural sulphites is to carefully select the grapes and the yeast and limit the contact of the wine with oxygen during the fermentation. Giulio Coceani, winemaker of the Coceani Winery explain how, Giulio says to make a sulphite free wine we follow a different process. First of all, we only leave very few bunches on the vine, only the healthiest. We then harvest the grapes, manual harvest to pick only the best grapes, and we do another selection of the grapes in the winery. We then press the grapes using a mechanical press to keep the skins intact, very slowly, advancing a couple of millimetres every hour because this process allows us to preserve the skins extracting only the best of the must. Then the must is fermented using its own yeast and moved to a special tank. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    One of the main problems for sulphite-free wine is the conservation and protection of the wine. It is worth mentioning that oxygenating the wine before drinking it, simply swirling the wine in the glass, release about 40% of the SO2 present in the wine and if there is too much SO2 in the wine, it smells of sulphur, similar to a match just lighted, when just opened."

The article is based on the comments made by wine expert Tim Hanni that consumers should ignore wines critics and just drink what they like. I always said that the palate develops with tasting, the more we taste the more we learn about wine. On the other side, tasting is different from drinking and enjoying a glass of wine. I do taste plenty of wines every day as part of my work, however, I do not drink all of them. A fantastic wine, a faultless wine, is not always something I would enjoy drinking. Wine reviews should be seen as they are, the opinions of someone who has tasted a few wines. However, a positive wine review does not mean that you will like the wine and if you don't, there is nothing wrong with you. In the same article, Hanni also  argues that nothing makes Mo&#277;t objectively \"better\" than Lambrini : it's all just pomp and profit but I completely disagree with it. A Moet is definitely better than a Lambrini, like it or not, but on the other side, there are plenty of champagnes better than Moet. I believe that every palate can appreciate a good, well made wine, whether experienced taster or not and this is the beauty of wine. Like art, whether expert or not, we all remain speechless in front of a painting. "

  description: "2009 wants to be the year of the great british food with big chefs telling us that the food we buy from supermarkets is not tasty as the one we could buy from a farm. I still don't understand how consumers can pretend and expect to get good quality at a cheap price, this can only happen for factory produced food where the economies of scale allow it; for natural, tasty and healthy food, it is simply impossible especially when supermarkets are making plenty of money and I have been telling this for years, well before those chefs came on TV. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The funny thing though, is that wine is considered differently from food, like it was made in a factory, whilst is exactly the same. How can we expect to pay a bottle of wine &pound;3 when duty and VAT make &pound;2 thus leaving &pound;1 for the wine and a bottle of mineral water, that do not require any work except the bottling, cost more than that. It is also interesting to read all wine writers now reviewing cheap bottles of wine that before they had snobbed, wines that have suddendly become drinkable. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Wine is like food, it is made with grapes and those grapes cannot be produced in a factory. The quality of the grape depends not only from the vintage but also from the yield of the vine: the lower the latter, the better the grapes and consequently the wine, the more buds are left on the vine during the pruning, the more grapes the vine will produce and the lower quality the grapes and the wine will be, this is why a decent wine cannot cost &pound;3 per bottle. Imagine if you are producing tomotoes in your garden, you look after them and you grown them carefully. If you were going to sell them, will they cost, and more than that, will they taste like the ones you can buy from the supermarket? I bet no. "

  description: "In the last few weeks the number of articles about wine and actions to reduce its environmental impact has grown exponentially. From supermarkets proudly announcing that have started to import wine in tanks and bottling it here, to wineries using lighter glass bottles or tetra pack boxes, and lastly, only a few days ago, a winery that will soon starting to use plastic bottles for their wines.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    However, and this is astonishing from a consumer and environmentalist point of view, these green press releases are adverts and there is no mention and little attention from the media of what happen in the vineyards and the environmental impact of the harmful substances used, heavy use of pesticide and chemical products, to ensure that independently of what nature does, the harvesting is safe and over production is achieved. And the environmental impact of these practices, a lot more damaging, could be reduced simply with a better vineyards management but the price of such wine will be higher and there could not be cheap wine on the supermarkets' shelves anymore. No wonder why this reduce the environmental impact of the wine talking only happens for cheap wines. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    A couple of evenings ago, on the news on TV, I have seen a report about the origin of the tuna available in our supermarkets' shelves, fished in the Philippines. This report highlighted the working conditions of the people there, working plenty of hours in very poor conditions and only getting paid &pound;1 a day; this will not be tolerated in any civilized country. In the studio, together with the news' presenter, there were two students and the spokesperson for the supermarkets' association and all she could say was that supermarkets were working very hard to ensure that the conditions of these people were fair, but still happy to do business with companies that were only paying &pound;1 per day at their employees. Where is the ethic on this? \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Only a few months ago, a TV campaign backed by the most famous chefs in the UK, showing the poor conditions in which intensively farmed chickens live, has upset the whole nation, forcing some supermarkets to ban chickens bred this way from their shelves, and at the same time, they and us, are happy to buy tuna from companies that pay &pound;1 a day to their employees and there is no chef or public campaign. I don't really get it.  We are so concerned about fair standards of living for animals, rightly so, but we don't do anything to help humans like us to live a fair life. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Unfortunately for us, in the UK, the market is dominated by supermarkets and we don't have much choice in what we eat and drink, and they only feed the media with the information they want us to know and the media, don't do their job, investigating the real situation. I am so fed up of hearing on TV and radio, in the good news section, that a new Tesco, or likes of, is opening creating hundreds of job. This is becoming a Tesco country and we will soon become its employees, all wearing the same made in China Tesco shirt, filling shelves for the rest of our life, and eating the same depressing food, but nobody, has so far, highlighted that for each new Tesco opening, plenty of local, independent shops close with as many jobs lost and the government, sadly, is inert in stopping Tesco from conquer the world.

Chocolate was thought to be better with other alcoholic drinks, warm, soft and round like Rum or Cognac but this opinion has changes thanks to a wave of wine lovers and experts happy to experiment. Matching wine and chocolate, however, is not an easy task due to the complexity of the chocolate itself and its thousand of variety and ingredients used. If for the most famous wine this exercise has already been made, for several other wines is still a work in progress and once again, a lot is up to personal taste, so there is plenty of room for people happy to experiment and come up with their own recommendations. I was recently asked to write a column about this subject, and as example I had thought of two famous Italian dessert wines, the Vin Santo and the Recioto di Soave, both wines match perfectly two different types of chocolate but then, when drinking a fantastic Amarone, I had some left in the glass, a box of chocolate appeared on the table so I decided to see whether I could find the perfect match for my wine. After a few less successful attempts, I did it. I found the perfect match in the Diplomat, a chocolate made with almonds, hazelnuts and milk chocolate but I am very confident that a chocolate made with hazelnuts and milk chocolate match perfectly with the Amarone. Vin Santo on the other side, is renowned for being a perfect match for the cantuccini with chocolate whilst the Recioto del Soave for matching perfectly the dark chocolate. There are plenty of other matched already made but I suggest you to try and experiment and see whether you can find your perfect match. However, as a principle, a few considerations must be made with regard to the wine. It is not possible to match all wines, only wines with certain characteristics can be matched with chocolate and those are complex wine, either sweet or aged, and with a high alcohol content. Why not come to one of our wine and chocolate tasting where you will be given plenty of chocolate and wine to play with and find your perfect match. "

    Bu this is not all, more wines will be added, my luggage and agenda is pretty much done for the Vinitaly, second week of April, where I will be tasting plenty of new wines and will bring them back to you. Our range will soon be the biggest range of high quality Italian wines from small producers available in the UK; there are a few sites that have copied us saying that they import from small Italian producers but when looking at their offering, I can see that not only they are not from small producers, but they don't import from Italy, they buy from other importers and the high quality mentioned is not there. I don't believe that a decent, drinkable, Italian wine can be found for less than about &pound;6, if you do find one, please let me know that I will be happy to buy it. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    On another subject, a couple of nights ago, I was watching the TV and found, by zapping, a very interesting program on BBC, Britain's really disgusting food, about what we eat and what is in it, however, like all other interesting programs, was on late, whilst plenty of junk programs are on prime time. These are what I would call educational programs and I think that children not just sleepless people like me should be able to watch, this is the only way if we want to start changing our bad eating habits and an episode investigating what goes in a bottle of wine could really open consumers' eyes and have an impact on the binge drinking culture because will move consumers away from cheap, tasteless, wines. Would you watch it?\r\n"

I completely disagree with this claim. Supermarkets are selling wines at their lowest price ever and many of them are supplied by Constellation. If, Constellation is, in any way moving towards premium wines, is simply because is closing plenty of wineries because they have realised that their strategy is not viable in the medium long term and are not making profits, and not because they have suddenly become champion of quality wine. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    According to the same article, Parker has lost the top spot because of the questionable ethics' of two of his contributors and because his favourite style of wine, 'big, ripe, high-alcohol wines', read my previous<a href=\"http://www.italyabroad.com/italian-wine-blog/53-parker-and-his-ratings\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> post </a></font> are becoming less and less interesting. This was inevitable. The biggest damage Parker has done to the wine industry as a whole, is that has made plenty of wine makers abandoning their styles, renounce their history and traditions, to make wines that could score high with him. The immediate consequence has been that all wines were similar and consumers got bored, as simply as that.\r\n\

    Why I don't really see the problem in being invited, all paid, to a tasting by a consortium or similar, I do see the problem when the trip is paid by a single producer to taste his or her wine but I don't see this as being the reason of an eventual decline of Parker. Parker was able to do what he did because he started in a different era, where the internet was still a project and wine was relatively unknown. Parker would never had become what he is if he had started now. Now, wine is an everyday drink, plenty of reliable information are available, free of charge, from the Internet and this allow consumers to make informed decisions. \r\n"

  page_title: The duty increase as a solution for the binge drinking
  description_short: "Last Wednesday as anticipated and expected, the Chancellor has announced the duty increase as an instrument to fight the binge drinking, however, we all know that this won't have any effect on the binge drinking but will only penalise conscientious drinkers and will help supermarkets in growing even more their market share and put small and independent and knowledgeable shops out of business."

Together with small and independent shops, once again, the consumers are the losers, consumers that enjoy responsibly a glass or two of wine with their meal, whilst the ones that binge drinking will still be able to find low priced alcoholic drinks.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In fact, the same day the Chancellor has announced the increase, an advertising campaign, from all major supermarkets, has started on the radio promoting half price beer and wine. Maybe not all consumers are aware that the increase will only have effect from tomorrow at midnight, but this has been launched to respond to the invasion of budget reports broadcasted by all TV and published by all papers to grab consumers' attention, suddenly everyone was thinking about the duty, and making them unconsciously buying as a response to the duty increase. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    What the government seems not to realise is that binge drinking can only be fought by educating people and especially youngster and forbidding supermarkets from selling low priced alcoholic drinks. I come from a country where the wine is widely available and it is cheap, no duty on it, and we never had the binge drinking problem, because more than a problem binge drinking is a culture and to fight a culture you need to educate people. If the culture is not changed, binge drinkers will simply move their buying habits towards something cheaper. Read my previous posting about binge drinking\r\n"

  description: "A group of 40 French winemakers were caught adding too much sugar to their wine during the fermentation. This process, called chaptalisation is not always permitted, each country has a different legislation. In Italy it is forbidden, in France it is forbidden as well however, depending on the quality of the vintage, can be authorised yearly by the Government. This process, adding sugar to the wine during the fermentation, raises the alcohol level of the wine. In this instance, the French government had authorised the chaptalisation of up to 2% and the winemakers caught, had added sugar for a 2.5% increase.  The sugar does not make the wine sweeter but adding alcohol, adds body to the wine. The reason of this post is not to shame French winemakers, but it is to introduce and explain a practice that it is sometime used to make low quality grapes into better wines. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The alcohol content of the wine depends of the sugar level of the grape, the higher the more alcoholic the wine will be, and, the sugar level is determined by the level of ripeness, the riper the higher the sugar level. Now, a part from bad vintages, where grapes don't reach the full ripeness because of weather conditions, and therefore can be improved by adding sugar, in other occasions, the sugar is the solution for not very good grapes obtained from a poor work in the vineyard. A stronger wine can hide several imperfections in the eyes of the non expert drinker. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The alcohol content can also be seen as an indicator of the quality of the wine, because, whilst for the new world where there are hot summers, a big, stronger wine is the norm, in cooler climates is not.  The alcohol is an important element of the wine but it is not the only one; the law high alcohol content equal to good wine is not correct. Another reason for high alcohol wines, in the case of big wine producers that don't grow their grapes, is that wine growers leave the grapes on the vine for longer because they are often paid according to the alcohol content of the grape, so they wait as long as possible thus picking the grapes when the optimal time is passed. \r\n"

  description_short: "Another scandal in the wine industry, another fraud discovered. Recently the French authorities have discovered that French wine sold to Ernest & Julio Gallo for its Red Bicyclette brand as Pinot Noir was in reality, cut with much less costly Syrah and Merlot. This is not the first case and I am confident will not be the last, however, only rarely they are discovered and this is a big issue. "

This is not the first case and I am confident will not be the last, however, only rarely they are discovered and this is a big issue. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is the direct consequence of big companies putting pressure on wine makers wanting to pay less and less for wine. In several occasions in my blog I raised the problem and said that wine cannot be made in a factory and therefore, if we want to pay little, we should be aware that we are compromising in quality or getting something else. This time, however, is different because the wine was not a cheap one and was sold with a premium price so it is even more worrying. This case teaches us another important lesson. Big producers rely on wine growers for grapes or wine and very often don't even know what goes in their bottles. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Going back to the fraud, what really surprises me is that the fraud went on for two years according to the French authorities and between all this time, no one at Gallo discovered it. For two years, consumers have bought Pinot Noir cut with Merlot and Syrah thinking of buying French Pinot Noir. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Grapes and wines have a wholesale market and relative prices, and in this case, the Pinot Noir has been cut by less expensive Merlot and Syrah. We often see similar price driven blends in cheap supermarket wines, where for example, the Pinot Grigio is blended with Chardonnay, with the last having a lower cost; behind every blend there should be a technical reason, a choice made by the wine maker based on the wine is trying to obtain, blending different grapes with different characteristics and not driven by cost.\r\n"

Through the program Tesco is showing us its shining facilities and offering the winner of the series, the opportunity of seeing his or her recipe transformed in a Tesco product. The program has been really well thought, Tesco wants to tell us that their products are made how we would make them, using the ingredients we would use, however, last week a lady went with a cake made with different spices and for all program they kept telling her to reduce the number of spices to reduce the price otherwise it would have been too expensive for Tesco's standards. This background voice telling the lady to cut the number of spices to reduce the price should have reminded to all of us, consumers, watching the program, if the profits announced by Tesco every year are not enough, that we get what we pay for and Tesco does not sell at loss and if in some instance the justification of economies of scale is applicable, in many more this is not. This applies particularly for the food segment. To keep prices down, Tesco has to use cheaper ingredients, full stop. And when someone says that Tesco buying big quantities can negotiate better deals, my response is that for the food, big quantity means lower quality. Think of the fruits of your garden and imagine a mass production, will you be able to look after your garden and put the same care and passion even if you had many more people, there is no chance you can get the same quality. \r\n\

From a wine drinker perspective though, there is no information about the wines included in the selection. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    When Italyabroad.com was set up, there were very few merchants if none, claiming to support and help small winemakers. In the last couple of years, these have grown exponentially, because writing on the website we support small producers is trendy and sells, now more than ever, where knowing the origin of our food has become a very delicate issue. Still, I can't understand how a small producer can afford to offer its wine for nothing, without even covering the bottling cost, forget about the rest, or the merchant can sell at a loss. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Our winemakers, really small ones, will never be able to do that and we will never ask them to, we won't be helping them if this was the case and we will never be in the position of selling our wines so cheaply without going out of business. What we do do, is to support our small wine makers emphasising the quality of their wine and food and the good value for money they offer. \r\n"

    I am very pleased to announce that we have just added another fantastic small producer from Piedmont to our portfolio. From the heart of the Gavi area, Tenuta San Pietro, produces fantastic Gavi wines using only hand picked Cortese grapes from their vineyards, and a Monferrato Rosso, a red wine made with Nibio, a type of Dolcetto grape. Their Gavis, not only shows what a proper Gavi shold be, able to outshine many other more rated wines, but also the versatility of the Cortese grape that can produce white wine with structure and complexity that we do not expect to.  
    
    I have discovered them at the last Vinitaly where I sat at the Consorzio di Gavi stand, in a sunny morning, and tasted more than 100 different producers, famous and not, big and small. The <a href="http://www.italyabroad.com/products/gavi-san-pietro"><font color="#0000FF">Gavi </a></font> Tenuta San Pietro had the highest score, it is what I was looking for in a Gavi, and it was only one of the very few that obtained the pass mark. I have always been very disappointed with the Gavi I had tasted, either because were bland, Gavi only in the name, or because they were lacking something. The Gavi Tenuta San Pietro is everything a Gavi should be. Why not try and let me know.

  description: "A couple of days ago I went to my local Sainsbury for some shopping and noticed the massive number of Pinot Grigio on offers, I recall at least 8 different ones. Surprised, I stopped and started looking the back label of each and every Pinot Grigio on the shelves, not only the ones on offer, trying to see the differences between them because their prices were ranging from &pound;4.99 to about &pound;9. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    As usual, the back label did not say much about the wines, a part from a few minor differences but not enough to justify such a price difference. I then, looked for hints  at where the wines were from, and I was even more surprised, when I realised that all the different wines were from only three bottlers. None of the wines were made by producers, they were made by 3 bottling companies. In Italy and for Italian wines, bottlers, do not have a good reputation for quality.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I would have been a nice and interesting exercise to taste the whole lot and see if there was, in reality, any difference on the quality of the wine for the different prices or the different labels were only a way to satisfy different consumers needs, from the ones that after the lowest price to the ones that are prepared to spend a few extra pounds for a better wine. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I can certainly say that, at the top of the price range, it is possible to find wines made by producers and not bottlers that will taste much better. For wine, like food in general, the origin tells a lot about what is in the bottle. "

If we take into account the duty, the Vat and all other accessory cost, I would say that the cost of the wine at the origin is probably 0.5 euros possibly less. In the production of this particular wine, there are 3 companies making a profit, the people producing the wine, the company bottling it and lastly, ASDA. I immediately took the bottle and read the back label, the front one did not say anything. The first thing I looked at was the producer and after a few seconds I saw that wine was bottled by a company outside the Soave DOC area. Then I was also attracted by the tasting notes written on the back label by the Asda's top wine buyer, I don't remember her name but she is a Master of Wine. All she was saying was that the wine was lively or something similar and was suggesting that the wine pair fish dishes and starter and it was 2006 vintage. I am sure she is very good, but I would never put my name on something I would never drink even if I was paid to do it, and I am pretty sure, she would never buy this wine if she saw it on a shelf, especially now. I don't think this wine has never been any good, but now it will be nearly oxidised and if I was her, I will ask for this wine to be removed from the shelves immediately\r\n\

  description: "A couple of days ago I have received an email from the Wine Gang with a  link to their online magazine and this was written in the introduction:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Supermarkets and high street chains account for a good four in five bottles that we take home and many column inches in our publications, not to mention this one. But with a handful of honourable exceptions, the supermarkets have hardly covered themselves with glory lately. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    By dragging wine downmarket to a point where their customers have come to expect cheapness at all costs, as it were, false expectations have been created that can't be fulfilled at the best of times, let alone in a time of recession and a floundering pound. Like it or not, wine, cheap wine especially, is getting dearer. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    One of the legacies of this folly is that the high street has shown us all that cheapness bears little relationship to value. Given the quick fixes of price and convenience, you could be forgiven for overlooking the fact that the independents are more likely to score over the high street with broader selections of higher quality wines and better services adapted to meet the needs of their customers.  (Anthony Rose)\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I don't need to add anything to it, it is very clear. I have been shouting it for the last few years and suddendly, someone else has realised it. Supermarket have never offered good value for money, they have been selling cheap wine but nothing to do with value for money. I hope that now their columns will focus more on wines from independent merchants offering value for money and less from supermarket. \r\n"

  description: "In the recent weeks something, many called it scandal, happened at Wine Advocate: two wine critics went to a wine trip fully paid by wine makers. This episode started a debate about wine critics and ethic that has bounced all over the internet with everyone adding its bit. Even if I haven't added my opinion then, I am afraid I will do it now because it is relevant to this post. I divide the wine writers into two categories, the ones that only write about wine without any commercial interest, and the second category, people like me, who write about wines but do have a commercial interest. The second category, I speak for my own personal experience, visit producers, taste and reviews wines. The ultimate aim for me is to find unknown gems, fantastic wines, and import them. I first taste the wines and then import the highest rated, not vice versa, and in this process, I am completely independent and not biased at all and  write about it on my blog. However, when writing, as a principle I never mention any producers, unless it is one of ours. I can discuss tastings and post my notes but never shame other producers. I believe that bad wines are important to appreciate the good ones and are part of our learning experience and the sooner we drink them, the better educated we become. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The first category, the one that does not have any commercial interest, that should be completely independent, the category where the two Parker's colleagues belong to, should be free from any link, and as Parker says pay their own way. Nevertheless, and this is the subject of this post, I think that the ethic should not only be pay your own way. I read papers and magazines like everyone else, and I am very surprised to read everywhere of the same wines, vintage after vintage, coming from the same places. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The majority of wine writers, including some of the UK most famous, only review wines that are sent to them, they don't go out and buy them. Is not the same than being paid for a wine trip?  Why a wine writer should be sent wines to be reviewed? Will not be more ethical for a wine writer to buy wines from the shop, taste and review them? Don't they get already paid for publishing their reviews? It is obvious that when Tesco send wines, it sends plenty of cases whilst an importer like me, will only send a case of 6 at the most and those get covered by the others. Simply read where the wines reviewed come from, and you will read, the same, usual names. Last year, I sent a case of wine to Tim Atkins and never heard since, not even a short email saying sorry, tasted your wines, not good enough to be mentioned in my reviews but thanks anyway, at today, I still don't know what happened to them and for sure, will not be sending anymore.  \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Fortunately, not all wine writers review only the wines received.  Recently, Bob Tyrer of The Times, in the preparation of his article about the Prosecco, bought  <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/product-search?text=prosecco\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Prosecco </a></font> from us and, I am sure, many others, and then reviewed them. For your information, our Prosecco was his <a href=\" http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/wine/article6008476.ece\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">favourite </a></font>. He is, what I would call, an ethically correct wine writer. I think that an ethically correct wine critic should buy its own wine and when it does, search for them, go beyond the usual places. The wine critic should be someone that does not only rate wines, but also make complicate or unknown wines famous and easy to buy and not someone that sit home and wait for the wines to come or go out to the same tastings. \r\n"

  page_title: Pinot Grigio from Naked Wines, lie or simply they have no idea of what they sell?
  description_short: A few days ago I was surfing the internet and ended up on the Naked Wines website on the Pinot Grigio page and was astonished to read what the say about it; I could only find two explanations, either  they have no idea about wines, at least Italian wines, or they are deceiving customers, could not find any other. Here explained why.

Here explained why. On the pinot grigio page, they say If you have drunk a gorgeous Pinot Grigio, on holiday in Veneto, and wondered where you can get that quality here in the UK...look no further!, unfortunately though, they sell a Pinot Grigio from Abruzzo, centre of Italy, not Veneto and this Pinot Grigio is not delle Venezie.  It can be seen where it says colline pescaresi IGT because IGT indicate the area where the wine comes from and, it is compulsory on the label , says hills around  Pescara, that is in  Abruzzo, not far from where I was born and lived for many years,  so I know the area well. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    A few information about the <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/site/base/guide1\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Pinot Grigio </font></a> wine and grape in Italy to better understand. The best, and only, regions for this grape and wine in Italy are Veneto, Trentino and Friuli, and from the latter, the Collio area produces the best wines; these three regions are also known as the North East of Italy. Everywhere else in Italy, the grape does not produce the same results and therefore is not planted, except from producers or bottlers, surely not small, that hope to jump on the Pinot Grigio wagon exploiting the big request for the wine and lack of knowledge around the world. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I also made a quick research on Italian wine books and magazines, I had never heard of the producer before, and could not find anything. Botter is not a small producers is a bottler and I am not even sure they own vineyards.  Naked Wines also says that they selected this PG out of a tasting of 59, with prices stretching up to &pound;12 a bottle. I am happy to give you, at the same price (simply send us copy of the invoice from Naked Wines showing the wine) one of our <a href=\" http://www.italyabroad.com/product-search?text=pinot+grigio\"><font color=\"#0000FF\"> Pinot Grigio </font></a>, certainly from small producers, that are a lot cheaper than &pound;12 and let you taste the difference and decide whether the difference in taste is worth the extra pounds. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    This episode proves once again, a part from how important is to know and trust the wine merchant and big marketing budget do not make up for it, that Italian wines are different, good Italian wines and cheap cannot go next to each other especially when who makes them is a small producer. Unfortunately, in the UK, the Italian wines sold, like the one from Naked Wines have nothing to do with proper Italian wines and only make wine drinkers looking for a good wine moving away from Italian ones and this is frustrating, I am really passionate about Italian wines and I think Italy makes some of the best wines in the world, it has a huge variety of wines and grapes, produces wine with the uao factors and can please any taste, however, this is often forgotten because of the majority of wines available are simply cheap, poor quality wines. \r\n"

  description: "My visit to the Vinitaly this year started with a mail I received immediately after landing with a link inviting me to read it. The link took me to an article, published by a very important weekly Italian magazine, called Velenitaly about two scandals currently happening in the Italian wine industry. The first and most important, they discovered that some of the cheap wine had been added with water and sugar and if you are wondering why sugar, is because when fermented, the sugar becomes alcohol. I am sure this does not happen only in Italy, the only difference is that in other countries these scandals are kept within the borders, in Italy, they like making as much noise as possible. As a general advice, an old world good wine can never be cheap. In the old worlds, France, Italy etc, the topography of the territory and the regulation  does not consent to make cheap wine unlike the new world, where there is very little legislation limiting the winemakers in their practices and the characteristics of the territory allow extensive growing. The second scandal involved the Brunello di Montalcino and its biggest producers, from Antinori to Banfi only to mention a couple, that cut their wine with grapes other than the Sangiovese Grosso which is the only grape allowed by law in the making of the Brunello. The main reason behind this is to make the Brunello drinkable without waiting several years as it will using only the Sangiovese grosso and more round and soft and this is a trend, that I personally don't like, that currently many producers of aged wines are following also because this is the type of wine, wine writers like and therefore score high and ultimately sell more. However, the downside of it, and this is why I don't like this practice, is that wines tend to lose their individual characteristics and they become very similar to each other. During the Vinitaly, one of my producers, told me that last year had been a very good year for Spanish and Portuguese wines because wine makers don't follow this trend. Leaving the scandals and going back to the Vinitaly, I found the 5 days too many, I think a better event could be organized in 3 days like any other wine fair. It was nice to see and speak to my producers, got to taste the new vintages and I am proud to say that their wines were better than ever, they have all improved compared to the previous vintage. After having met my producers and tasted their new vintages or previews, it took me three days and plenty of bread and ham to accompany the wine I drunk, I then went to discover new producers and new wines.  If I have been very disappointed by regions like Apulia and Sicily that have become too commercial and too interested in making big quantities of wine like the new world, I was very positively surprised by regions like Trentino and Campania, with the first a new region on the wine map especially for the whites, whilst for the second, after a few years where there were only a few big producers, now a lot of small and passionate wine makers are coming producing fantastic wines, hopefully, without becoming another Sicily or Apulia.

    \r\n\
    Chocolate has always been seen like something that was too much for the wine and has always been matched with other alcoholic drinks such as Rum and Cognac but this has changed thanks to a wave of wine lovers and experts happy to play with the subject and come up with their recommendations. However, this is not an easy task to the complexity of the chocolate itself and the infinite variety and the ingredients used. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I was recently asked to write a column about this subject, and as example I had thought of two famous Italian dessert wines, the Vin Santo and the Recioto di Soave, both wines match perfectly two different types of chocolate but then, when drinking a fantastic Amarone, I had some left in the glass, a box of chocolate appeared on the table so I decided to see whether I could find the perfect match for my wine. After a few less successful attempts, I did it. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I found the perfect match in the Diplomat, a chocolate made with almonds, hazelnuts and milk chocolate but I am very confident that a chocolate made with hazelnuts and milk chocolate match perfectly with the Amarone. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Vin Santo on the other side, is renowned for being a perfect match for the cantuccini with chocolate whilst the Recioto del Soave for matching perfectly the dark chocolate. There are plenty of other matched already made but I suggest you to try and experiment and see whether you can find your perfect match. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    However, as a principle, a few considerations must be made with regard to the wine. It is not possible to match all wines, only wines with certain characteristics can be matched with chocolate and those are complex wine, either sweet or aged, and with a high alcohol content. Why not come to one of our wine and chocolate tasting where you will be given plenty of chocolate and wine to play with and find your perfect match.\r\n"

  description: "First of all, a good wine is a good wine independently. Organic does not make a good wine, a skilled winemaker and healthy grapes are still needed. I recently saw on TV the result of a survey about the attitude toward organic food in this credit crunch and their sales were down, apparently, due to the fact that consumers do not really understand what organic means and because these products are often thought to attach a premium.\r\n \r\n\
    So, what are organic wines and food then? Organic wines and food are food or wines made using organic grown ingredients.  What does it mean? It means that the wine grower or the farmer cannot use chemical or non natural products in the field or vineyard, respecting the environment and not exploiting it. Not only, at least according to the Italian legislation, the organic certification can only be given if the farm or vineyards does not border with other conventional cultivated fields because chemical products can spread by air or soil and therefore contaminate the organic field and to avoid this, enough space should be in between.   These are the main differences, others include lower yield per hectare and for the wine, less sulphites added. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Do they carry a premium? Yes and not. Yes, when the producer is a big one, in fact when we buy them from the supermarkets, we do pay a premium. It is easily imaginable the extra cost and risk for a mass producer in going organic and this is incorporated in the price.  Not in the case of small producers. Why? Because they do not have the huge fixed costs that big producers have and they already follow good practices, keeping their yield low, adding little sulphites to the wines and using only the best grapes or ingredients through a careful selection.\r\n \r\n\
    So, concluding, organic on the label does not say anything about the quality of the wine or the food, it only means how the grapes or ingredients are farmed, and it is all down to the wine maker or farmer to make a good wine or food out of them. \r\n"

I also had to take screenshots of the page because I felt threatened and I know they can afford better lawyers than I do.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I accept their explanation, however, I don't think that this is an acceptable mistake from someone who, for living, sells wine.  They also say that this was the best value for money Pinot Grigio they tasted when I wrote about the quality of the wine. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I said to them that my post was not about quality, even though I, and all wine magazines and books, doubt about it but was about giving wine drinkers the right information for them to make conscientious choices. What they have done with the description, mentioning Veneto, and calling the wine Pinot Grigio delle Venezie is make consumers believe that the wine is a Pinot grigio delle Venezie when is not. Not even supermarkets are offering a Pinot grigio delle Venezie a &pound;4.99. In fact one of the feedback left on the wine says that at &pound;6.99 (what should be the normal price) \"will buy a better wine in the supermarket\".\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I have just checked their website again and they have removed delle Venezie from the wine name however, Veneto is still mentioned on the description even though the wine does not come from there and they now know it. I let you make your own mind."

When buying wines like Barolo or Brunello di Montalcino, but not only, what determines the quality and the price of the wine is the vintage. In countries like Italy but I would include the whole old world, not all vintages are the same. In many countries of the old world a lot of practices in the vineyards, such as irrigation, are not allowed. This, in simple words, means that not two vintages are the same due to the different weather conditions. In the new world, where these practices are allowed, there is no much difference between vintages. Now going back to the initial question, buying a Barolo vintage 2002 or buying a vintage 2000 is not the same. The 2000 was rated as 5 star vintage versus the 2002 which was only rated 2 stars. What does this mean? 5 star vintage means that the wine has all elements to produce a fantastic wine and last for years or decades, the alcohol, the acidity and the tannins. This also means that you can buy a bottle now, store in your cellar for 10 years and then open it. You can be pretty certain that it will be a real pleasure drinking it. When buying the 2002, with good producers not bottling it and using the grapes for their nebbiolo, if you buy it and keep the wine in your cellar for 10 years, when drinking it you can be pretty certain that it will be vinegar. I will invite you to try Brasato al Barolo to rid of it and still impress your guest. If you still want to buy it, because you still think it is a good deal, make sure you drink it soon but when drinking it expect to drink an oaked nebbiolo, surely with harsh tannins and definitely not round. I also want to take the opportunity to share a couple of tips to spot good restaurants or shop. If you go to a restaurant and see that for expensive wines, not only Italian but also French or Champagne, don't have the vintage or the NV for non vintages Champagne, the restaurant does not know much about wines, and if you really want to know whether the wine is worth the money you are paying for, ask for the vintage. If you are not sure about the vintage or if the wine is too young even if of a good year, then it is almost surely not worth the money you are paying for, so choose something else. Wines not ready to be drunk are often found in restaurants wine list. Wines, especially the aged ones, the Riserva, need a few years after the release of the vintage before being ready to be drunk and many restaurants sell wines that have just been releases and always doubt of sommeliers that recommend wines without asking what you will eat If you have any experience or any question let me know.

  description: "A few days ago I was surfing the internet and I came across different articles about the top 10 Italian wines, from the number of articles found seems to be a hot issue, from different wine writers including one from Jonathan Ray of the Daily Telegraph and the majority of lists were featuring all the usual wines made by the big Italian producers. The one from Jonathan Ray was slightly different because it had a few big names and was considering only wines from the historic Italian wine regions, Veneto, Piedmont and Tuscany and a couple more and going through the lists, I was very surprised and disappointed to find wines like the Canaletto Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, which is what I define a cheap supermarket wine, and being born in Abruzzo I know a bit about our wines and producers and the Canaletto Montepulciano D'Abruzzo (bottled by a company based in Veneto that buys the grapes in Abruzzo) is not. Masciarelli or Valentini are only 2 of the fantastic producers we have in Abruzzo. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The article is dated the 8th of February but I want to draw from it to discuss my ideal top 10 Italian wines. I agree that the beauty of Italy is the hundred different grapes but also equally, the country's morphology that makes Italy unique. One of the opening statement of the list was that Italy produces very good wine and very poor, I agree but this is true for all countries, new world and old world and the name of the wine should not be a problem like is not for the French wines and this different names should make people trying and discovering new wines and stimulate their curiosity. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    I am personally against big producers for the reason you can read of on the website and I think Italy has a lot to offer in terms of small producers and wines that my list will not include any of the big names. Moreover, I also think that the list of the top Italian wines has to include wines and grapes from regions where they have found their perfect terroir and I think, that for example the Pinot Grigio grape, because of the soil and micro climate, gives its best in Friuli and not in Tuscany or Sicily. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    What I found was missing from all these lists is the current Italian wine situation. I think that Italian wines made by small producers, with a few exceptions, is now pretty good, there are a few stars as well, whilst this is not always the case for the wines made by big producers like the ones we find in supermarkets. I have already said that Italy cannot make cheap wines because of its characteristics, intended as the morphology of the country and the too many regulations that regulate the industry that limit the winemakers in many things and we should all stay away from them because there is something wrong about it, but the list of top 10 Italian wines I read, none of them tells you the evolution that is taking place in Italy. Classic wine making regions are losing market and new ones are coming out and for me, Campania and Trentino and Sardinia, have the biggest potential and, a part of a couple of big names that have become boring and have lost their enthusiasm in making wine, driven by a young generation of wine makers are producing fantastic wines and my top 10 list will definitely have a few wines from there. Two regions I will exclude from this list are Apulia and Sicily that keep disappointing me, that after a fantastic start a few years ago, they have now become boring and over valued in some case or of very poor quality on the other and I will make sure to fill the other positions keeping an open mind. \r\n\

  description: "This morning I went to a supermarket to get some eggs and milk and while standing, choosing which brand of free range eggs to buy, I started looking at the shopping baskets of the other people buying free range eggs. I don't shop at supermarket unless I feel lazy and for me all supermarkets are the same, I don't believe in good and bad supermarkets. I have tasted first hand and seen that everything tastes the same, I even found the company making the products being the same for different supermarkets, with the only difference being the packaging and the brand. I have learned that if you want to get something tasty from the supermarkets, when available, it costs exactly the same price of the shop around the corner. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Because I had not been in one for sometime, I was positively surprised to see the number of free range eggs now available. I remember only a few months ago, before the series of TV programs, there were only a couple of options for me to choose from, now they even took over the cages one. However, what I have also noticed is that consumers were paying a lot of attention for certain food items, the ones appeared on TV such as chicken, eggs or pork, but none for the others, including the wines. I could see free range eggs costing &pound;2 next to a bottle of wine costing &pound;3 or free range chicken costing several pounds next to the 3 for &pound;10 wines. It is good that consumers are starting to look at where their food comes from, but, this should apply to all purchases, independently of whether they have been featured on TV or not. Reading the label is something that we are all capable of doing.  \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Only in the last few weeks, I have read of several cases of wine frauds, but I guess I read about them because I read industry reports and magazines and these cases never make the big TV. Also, newspapers and magazines keep reviewing and promoting cheap wine, I guess, they want to be near to their readers in this current climate but wine is made by grapes that, in their way, are similar to chickens or pork and depending on how they are grown produce different results. Lower yield means better grapes and better wine, a bit more expensive, but with a richer bouquet and more flavour. On the other side, cheaper wine but flavourless. It is our choice."

    After a long wait, the 2008 vintage of the <a href="http://www.italyabroad.com/products/sauvignon-scubla"><font color="#0000FF">Sauvignon</font></a> Scubla has finally arrived for the joy of us all, however, we only received 400 bottles, of which a couple of dozens will end in my own cellar, and this will be all for the year. Roberto Scubla only produces a few thousand bottles of Sauvignon and in the last few years its quality has been outstanding, in fact the wine is sold before it is even released and there is a fight amongst all of his importers in trying to get as much as possible, last year we run out in October. 
    
    Roberto Scubla is a perfectionist and his wines are released only when they are ready, does not matter if the previous vintage has finished and the market is demanding them. And the 2008 vintage was only ready now. One aspect of wine  making that not many drinkers know is that the right time for a wine does not   always come at the same time, some vintages can be early some other can be late.   There are several elements that determine when the wine is be ready and the only way to see when the time is right, is by tasting it on a daily basis. 
    
    Together  with the Sauvignon Scubla, we also received the <a href="http://www.italyabroad.com/products/greco-masseria-frattasi"><font color="#0000FF">Greco</font></a> and <a href="http://www.italyabroad.com/products/coda-di-volpe-masseria-frattasi"><font color="#0000FF">Coda di Volpe</font></a>, two new white wines from Campania, and the <a href="http://www.italyabroad.com/products/moscato-passito-masseria-frattasi"><font color="#0000FF">Moscato Passito</font></a> from the same region and producer.

  description_short: Last week Italyabroad.com we to the London International wine fair and we had a fantastic time. A part from having a successful event with all our visitors complimenting us for our portfolio wine, we tasted plenty of new wines, Italian and not. The Italian tasting was for business whilst the rest of the world one was pleasure and I have to admit that we tasted plenty of good and bad wine, but as I always say, it helps in refining the tasting skills.

The Italian tasting was for business whilst the rest of the world one was pleasure and I have to admit that we tasted plenty of good and bad wine, but as I always say, it helps in refining the tasting skills. The event is also the occasion where the result of the major UK wine competitions, Decanter world wine award and International wine challenge are released and this time we only submitted 4 wines, it gets every year more expensive to participate and I don't believe in the way the wines are judged and the medals are given, but still we won 4 medals. When I say that I don't believe in these competitions, I mean, that I still think that good wines are given medals, but the big winners, are, often in my opinion formed after having tasted several of them in the last few years not the best. This year, one of the wines we entered got a bronze medal and the reason of the bronze was, according to the judges, too much oak. This wine, the new vintage of Preziosaterra Dal Cero, only spend 4 months in not new barrel and in fact, tasting the wine you could see that the oak was there but the reason was that the wine is not yet ready. This makes me thinking that the judges on these competitions, taste the wines in a rush, without any consideration on the wine and probably these is one of the reason why tend to award wines that are ready instead of wine that, even if not yet, are the best wine. Amongst the winners I tasted, I also tasted the Amarone Classico Zenato, winner of the International wine and spirit competition together with a wine consultant, and none of us was impressed by it. I am inviting you to taste and compare the wine with our Amarone and let me know which you think taste better. "

  description: "I probably spend too much time eating out and one of my criterions to evaluate the restaurant I am going to is to look at the wine list and exactly at the house wine. The house wine tells me a lot about the restaurant. A good house wine, to me, means not only that I will find good quality wines, but also that the food will be as good. For me the house wine shows the character of the restaurant. If the restaurant has chosen a good quality wine as a house wine, I am confident that the same effort and attention is given when buying the ingredients used in the kitchen and delivering the food. Unfortunately, the vast majority of restaurants, do not have a decent house wine. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The house wine is often considered the cheap wine, the poor wine, the wine that customers who don't want to spend, choose, and the way it is chosen by restaurants is its price, the lower the better, who cares about the quality of the wine. And I found poor quality house wine even in good restaurants where the food was fantastic but was spoiled by the wines. In the last few months, due to the current climate, I have found many restaurants changing their house wine and wine list in general, replacing their selection with cheaper options. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    House wine is the cheapest wine on the list, however, it is often worth to spend an extra couple of pounds and pick a wine in the middle of the list.  If you are not too sure about the house wine, simply don't buy it, choose something else, choose a wine that you know or if you don't know any, remember the rule above and remember, cheap does not have anything to do with quality.  \r\n"
