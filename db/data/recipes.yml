  preparation: |
    In a bowl, place the ricotta, grated cheese, egg, and salt. Add 1 cup of the flour and mix. Add only as much more flour as you need to create a workable dough. Be careful not to overwork. Divide the dough into fist size pieces, and roll into long logs as thick as your thumb. Cut into 1 inch slices and gently place on a lightly floured baking sheet. Continue with the rest of the dough in this manner. If not using immediately, place in the refrigerator. To prepare the sauce, heat the oil and add the garlic cooking only until fragrant. Do not brown. Add the tomatoes, basil, and seasonings and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes. To cook the gnocchi, drop into lightly salted water and remove as soon as they float to the top, after 1 or 2 minutes. Place in a warmed bowl, top with some of the tomato sauce and the mozzarella cubes and gently mix. Serve with additional sauce if desired.

  preparation: "Season the veal shanks with salt and pepper and dredge in the flour, shaking off excess. In a heavy skillet, heat 3 Tbsp butter and 3 Tbsp oil over mod?high heat. Brown the veal shanks, adding additional butter and oil if necessary. Transfer the shanks as they are browned to a platter. Add wine to the skillet, boil the mixture, deglazing the pan, until the liquid is reduced to about a half cup. Reserve in a small bowl. In a flameproof casserole just large enough to hold the veal shanks in one layer, cook the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic in the remaining 4 Tbsp butter over mod?low heat, stirring occasionally, until the veggies are softened. Add the shanks and any accumulated juices to the casserole. Add the wine mixture, and enough broth to almost cover the shanks. Spread the tomatoes over the shanks, add the bouquet garni (6 fresh parsley sprigs, 4 fresh thyme sprigs, 1 bay leaf) and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the liquid to a simmer over moderately high heat. Braise the mixture, covered, in the middle of a preheated 325f oven for 2 hours, or until the veal is tender. Transfer the veal to an ovenproof serving dish with a slotted spoon. Discard the strings and keep the shanks warm. Strain pan juices into a saucepan, pressing hard on the solids. Skim off the fat. Boil for about 15 minutes or until reduced to about 3 cups. Baste the shanks in some of the reduced juices, and bake them, basting 3?4 more times, for 10 minutes or until the shanks are glazed. In a bowl, stir together the parsley, zest, and garlic. Sprinkle the shanks with the gremolata and pour some juice around and over them. Serve the remaining juices alongside in a boat. "

In a bowl, place the ricotta, grated cheese, chopped spinach, egg, and salt. Add 1 cup of the flour and mix. Add only as much more flour as you need to create a workable dough. Be careful not to overwork. Divide the dough into fist size pieces, and roll into long logs as thick as your thumb. Cut into 1 inch slices and gently place on a lightly floured baking sheet. Continue with the rest of the dough in this manner. If not using immediately, place in the refrigerator. To cook, drop into lightly salted water and remove as soon as they float to the top, after 1 or 2 minutes. Place in a warmed bowl. Melt the butter in a small pan and add the sage leaves. Add salt & pepper and pour this mixture over the cooked gnocchi. Top with the parmesan and serve. "

    Let the meat marinate in the wine, celery, carrot, chopped onion and cloves for one day. Remove the meat from the marinade, wrap and tie tightly in a cheesecloth and place in an oval pan just large enough to hold it together. Put back in the marinade and cook slowly for about one hour. Remove from heat and let the meat cool in its cooking juice. 
    De-grease and filter the cooking liquid. Blend the liquid in a food mill with the tuna, anchovies, 1 tbs. capers and egg yolks. Dilute the sauce with lemon juice, and vinegar, and whisk in the oil in a steady stream till you get a velvety sauce similar to mayonnaise. Slice the veal and arrange in a serving platter in the following manner: Spread a few tablespoons of the sauce on the platter. Add the veal a layer at a time, with sauce covering each layer. Sprinkle capers over and decorate the rim of the platter with the sliced lemon. Serve

  preparation: |
    It is best to use fresh tagliolini. Be careful to cook them only until they are "al dente", meaning there is still a definite bite to the pasta. Fresh pasta is very easy to overcook so taste the pasta every two minutes or so to be safe. Strain the pasta and immediately stir in enough butter to lightly coat the pasta (without creating a butter sauce). Arrange the tagliolini in individual pasta bowls in such a manner as to create a "nest", leaving a center area that is slightly depressed. In the center of the nest place a raw quail egg yolk - only the yolk, not the white. (Be sure to buy the eggs from a trusted grocer.) Use a truffle shaver to shave the fresh white truffle (conserved until now in a jar of dry rice if not purchased that day) over the pasta. Shave away, trying to put an equal amount on each plate and not an obviously large amount on your own. Serve.

Flour a baking sheet and place the logs on it, giving them each some room, and slide into preheated oven. Bake for 20 minutes, or until they're a nice gold color. While the logs are still warm, cut them into 1 inch thick slices and then cook them for another five minutes. Let them get cool before serving. (Hint: You don't have to eat them all at once.

Untie the pork loin and lay flat, boned (rough) side facing up. Spread generously with the herb mixture, then sprinkle generously with more freshly ground black pepper. Re?tie the roast with kitchen twine. You can do this the evening before you plan to serve the roast, or earlier in the day. Put the roast in a heavy pot just large enough to accomodate it, and add just enough water to barely cover it. Add about 1 Tbs. salt to the pot and bring to the boil, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface. When the water boils, lower the heat to medium, so it's not boiling, but bubbling fairly briskly. Cook until the water boils off??about one hour. Add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan, and continue cooking over medium heat and, when the roast develops an nice crust all over, remove to a warm platter and allow it to rest for approximately fifteen minutes.

Once the mixture is reduced to a paste, add a little bit of ground pepper to it, stir half the oil into it, and rub it into the chicken. Let the chicken marinate for an hour or so. In the mean time, build a hot fire in your barbecue. Place the chicken on a rack about 6 inches above the coals and grill it, turning it often and basting it with the remaining olive oil. The chicken will take an hour or slightly more to cook; it will be done when the meat begins to pull up along the drumsticks and the juices run clear if you insert a skewer into the hip joint. "

  preparation: |
    Dough: 1. Use your electric mixer. In a mixing bowl measure 1 cup flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon.. Attach bowl and dough hook. Turn to medium?slow speed and blend for approximately 45 seconds. With the mixer running, add vinegar, water, egg and butter. Mix to blend for 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, as needed to make a dough that clings to the hook. 2. Knead for 5 minutes. If dough clings to the sides of the bowl, add sprinkles of flour. Dough will be smooth and elastic. 3. Wrap the soft dough in foil or plastic and refrigerate to relax and chill for at least 1 hour. 4. Heat at least 2 inches of vegetable oil to 375 degrees. 5. Place dough on a floured work surface and roll extremely thin?? 1/16 inch or less! Don't rush. When the dough pulls back, allow it to relax. If it softens and sticks, return it to the frig for 5 or 10 minutes. Cut 4 1/2 inch circles (size of a many small margarine tub lids!) Roll the dough scraps out and continue until all dough is used. You should have 12 to 14 circles. 6. When the circles are cut, roll again just before placing on the cannoli tubes. This will give them an oval shape, about 5 inches by 4 1/2 inches. 7. Place the dough so that its longest dimension is the length of the metal tube. Brush the tip of the dough with egg white to seal. Toll dough on the tube. 8. Deep frying. The length of time will depend of the thickness of the shells. A very thin shell will need about 2 minutes. A thicker shell could require up to 6 minutes. Fry two or three at a time. Turn over once during frying. Fry until golden brown. Remove with tongs. Cool for a few minutes and then push the tubes free to use again. Cool shells completely before filling. Filling: 1. Cream ricotta cheese in a bowl with a spatula or wooden spoon or with an electric mixer until smooth, about 5 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar, vanilla, candied fruit, chocolate, cinnamon and orange curacao. Continue beating another 4 or 5 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to fill shells. 2. Use a small spoon to stuff the filling into the shells. Dip the ends in chopped nuts. Sift confectioners' sugar over the shells and serve. 3. Unfilled shells can be stored in a cool, dry place for three to four weeks, or frozen for three months.

    Preheat oven to 400 F.
    
    Snap off the tough bottoms of the asparagus and discard. Wash spears and pat dry, then place in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour olive oil over asparagus and roll spears until evenly coated. Arrange spears in a single layer and season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.
    
    Cover dish with foil and bake 12 to 15 minutes until asparagus is tender when pierced with the tip of a knife (dish can be prepared ahead to this point).
    
    Pass a vegetable peeler across the surface of room-temperature Parmigiano-Reggiano to create 1/4 cup of thin slivers. Scatter the slivers over the asparagus and return the dish to the oven. Continue baking just until cheese softens, about 2 to 3 minutes.
    
    Place asparagus onto warm plates and sprinkle with several drops of balsamic vinegar and the chopped parsley or snipped chives. Serve immediately.

    Bring water to a boil in a large heavy pot. Add salt and reduce heat until water is simmering. Take cornmeal by the handful and add to water very slowly, controlling the flow to a thin stream through your fingers. To avoid lumps, stir quickly with a long handled wooden spoon while adding cornmeal. If necessary, stop adding cornmeal from time to time and beat mixture vigorously. Cook, stirring constantly, 20 to 30 minutes. Polenta will become very thick while cooking. It is done when it comes away cleanly from the sides of the pot. Pour polenta into a large wooden board or a large platter. Wet your hands and smooth out polenta evenly, about 2 inches thick. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes or until polenta solidifies. Cut cooled polenta into slices 1 inch wide and 6 inches long. Place slices in individual dishes. Serve hot, covered with your favorite sauce. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

  preparation: "Heat the olive oil over moderate heat in a four to six quart pot, then add the onion, celery and carrot, stirring as they go in. Saut&eacute;	 the vegetables until they become soft and slightly browned??about ten minutes. Raise the heat to high and add the calamari. Saut&eacute;	, stirring constantly, until they become purple and begin to brown slightly??two or three minutes. With the heat still on high, add the red wine, scraping the bottom of the pot for any bits of vegetables that may have caramelized. Boil for a minute or two in order to evaporate the alcohol. Reduce the heat to low, and, with the pot off the stove, add the tomatoes, crushing them with the back of a fork as they go in. Return the pot to the stove and bring the calamari/tomato/wine mixture to the simmer. Simmer gently while you prepare the mussels and clams. In a separate four to six quart pot, add the mussels, clams and water, then bring to the boil. Cover the pot, lower the heat to medium and allow the shellfish to steam for about five minutes, or until their shells open. Discard any that have not opened. When they have finished steaming, remove the pot from the stove and remove the shellfish with a slotted spoon, reserving the steaming liquid. When the shellfish are cool enough to handle, remove them from their shells. Add the shrimp and optional scallops to the simmering tomato mixture, raising the heat if necessary to maintain the simmer. Cook for approximately three minutes, until the shrimp begin to turn pink. Add the clams and mussels and their reserved steaming liquid, being careful at the end not to add any sand that may have precipitated to the bottom of the pot. Simmer for an additional three minutes, stirring gently once or twice. Add the fish, but do not stir the pot this time as it will cause the fish to break apart further. You're seeking a finished dish with large chunks of fish in addition to the other seafood. Simmer for five minutes, then remove the pot from the heat. If using bruschetta, place a piece in each of four bowls, then ladle the soup over the bread, being careful to include a sample of each type of seafood you've cooked. Garnish each bowl with the freshly chopped parsley and a few grinds of black pepper. Serve at once. "

Then add the ricotta, grated parmesan and two beaten egg yolks. Mix all the ingredients through thoroughly and you should end up with a nice manageable filling paste. Take your pasta dough out of the fridge and roll two thin sheets. On one sheet place equal portions of the filling and make sure they are evenly spaced. Then lay your second sheet of pasta on top and press the two pasta sheets together gently around each of the fillings. Then cut round the individual portions to create square raviolis. Then all you have to do, is drop them into a pan of salted boiling water and they will cook in 60 seconds. Drain them and serve with the sauce of your choice. "

  preparation: "Biga: Mix the yeast and water together, and then slowly start adding the flour, mixing well. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for up to 6 hours. Refrigerate overnight. Preparation -Bread Place the water in a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast overtop and mix well. Let sit 10 minutes until bubbly. Add the biga, flour, and salt and stir with a wooden spoon (or mix with your hands) until everything is mixed. The dough will be fairly wet and sticky at this point. Cover and let stand in a warm spot for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours until doubled in volume. Punch down the dough, folding it over on itself two or three times, cover and let rise once more until doubled, about 1 hour. If you choose, you could refrigerate your dough at this time and leave it overnight to prepare the next day. Turn out your dough onto a floured baking sheet, and without overworking it too much shape into one large or two smaller round or oval shaped loaves, using as much extra flour as needed to keep it from sticking. Slash across the tops of the loaves with a serrated knife or razor just prior to baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. and place a casserole dish with boiling water on the lower oven rack. Bake your bread 30 minutes, turn the baking sheet around, and reduce the heat to 300 degrees and bake for another 30?45 minutes. At this point your bread should be golden brown and should sound hollow when you tap the bottom. Allow the bread to cool to room temperature and serve. "

  preparation: "This dish requires presoaked grain, which takes time to prepare. To start from scratch, purchase 1/2 pound whole grain and soak it in cold water for two weeks, changing the water every two days. Come cooking time, drain it and cook the amount indicated. The pastiera is traditionally served in a 10-inch diameter round metal pan with a two-inch rim. Begin the day ahead by cooking the soaked grain with the milk, zest, lard, sugar and vanilla over an extremely low flame for at least four hours, or until the grains come apart and the milk has been absorbed, so that the mixture is dense and creamy. The next morning make the pie crust: Make a mound of flour, scoop a well in the middle, and fill it with the lard, sugar and yolks. Use a fork or pastry cutter to combine the ingredients, handling the dough as little as possible (don't knead it). Once you have obtained a uniform dough press it into a ball and cover it with a damp cloth. Pass the ricotta through a strainer into a large bowl, stir in the 3/4 cup sugar, and continue stirring for 5-6 minutes. Next, stir in the yolks, one at a time, and the grain. Next add the orange water; begin with half the amount and taste. Add more if you would like it orangier, keeping in mind that the aroma will fade some in baking. Stir in the cinnamon and the candied fruit as well, then whip the whites to soft peaks and fold them in. Roll out 2/3 of the pastry dough and line the pan. Fill it with the filling. Next, roll out the remaining dough and cut it into strips, which you will want to lay across the filling in a diagonal pattern (lift them from the pastry cloth with a long spatula to keep them from breaking). Bake in a moderately hot oven (180 C or 370 F) for an hour or slightly more. The filling should dry almost completely and firm up, while the pie crust should brown lightly. Serve the pie in its pan, and continue to enjoy it over the next few days for breakfast. "

Arrange the sliced fennel around the tenderloin and add the 1/2 cup of wine. Bake until a thermometer reaches an internal temperature of 155 degrees, which is about 30 minutes. Turn the sliced fennel over during the cooking period at least once. Remove the tenderloin from the baking dish and keep warm. After 15 minutes, slice into 1/2 inch slices. Add the broth to the juices and vegetables in the pan and turn to high heat. Allow the sauce to reduce, and serve over the slices of meat, garnishing with the roasted fennel. "

  preparation: |
    Slice off the top of the Panettone, about one inch down. Using a sharp knife, hollow out the Panettone, leaving a layer about 1/2 inch thick on the sides and bottom. 
    Meanwhile, prepare the zabaione, using the egg yolks, granulated sugar, saffron, 3/4 cup wine and the orange extract. Sprinkle the gelatin over the remaining 1/2 cup wine. As you cook the zabaione in a double boiler, add the softened gelatin and the wine and stir well. Transfer the zabaione to a crockery or glass bowl and allow it to cool. Refrigerate until quite firm (about one hour). 
    Using a chilled metal bowl and wire whisk, whip the cream along with the confectioners sugar, then add the cooled zabaione. Whip again to produce crema zabaione. Pour the crema zabaione into the Panettone container. Put the lid back on the top, completely wrap the stuffed Panettone with aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight. 
    The following day, cut the Panettone in half vertically and each half into four wedges. Serve immediately with orange zest sprinkled over.

    Use a long platter, and arrange in the following order: Salami, provolone, tomato, onion, red peppers, and anchovies. Put the baby corns and olives in the center of tray. Take and cut in half celery sticks. Then slice each again lengthwise. Arrange celery sticks in between each antipasto. Sprinkle some salt lightly on everything. Then drizzle olive oil on everything. Let the antipasti sit covered in the refrigerator till ready to serve. Sitting helps enhance the flavours.

To make the garlic aioli, place the garlic and eggs in a blender. Pulse to combine. Begin to slowly add the oil into the blender top while it is blending to create a thick emulsion. Once thick, remove from the blender, and add the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Drizzle the sauce over the carpaccio on the plates. Serve. "

Place tomatoes, salt & pepper, basil and balsamic vinegar in a glass bowl and set aside for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Boil water for pasta. Just before you put the pasta in the water, drain tomatoes and reserve the juice that runs off. (I usually set my colander on a dinner plate). Put the angel hair pasta in the water to cook for the recommended amount of time. Heat your garlic skillet and toss drained tomatoes briefly JUST to heat. They should retain their shape. The pasta should finish cooking (usually no more than 5 minutes for angel hair) at the same time the tomatoes are ready. Toss the pasta and tomato mixture together and serve with freshly grated parmesan cheese. "

Remove the toothpicks from the bundles, and return them to the frying pan. Add the fresh parsley, and cook until heated through, about 3-4 minutes. Serve hot with a side dish of your choice. "

Peel away the tough outer leaves of the artichokes, trim the tops perpendicular to the length of the artichokes, and cut the artichokes into eighths. Soak them in the acidulated water for an hour. Then rinse them, pat them dry, flour them, dredge them in the egg, and fry them until crisp and golden in hot, but not really hot oil (you don't want the outside to burn before the inside is cooked)

    Shell the peas. Make a battuto with pancetta and onion: put in a saucepan, add half the butter and the oil, and lightly fry until the pancetta melts and the onion loses its crunchiness. Do not let it become brown. Add the green peas and a ladle of broth. Stir and let cook on low heat for about 10 mins. (if the peas are tough cook for 5 more mins). 
    When the peas are halfway cooked, add all the broth, bring to a boil, add the rice and cook over medium heat. Stir frequently, adding additional broth if necessary (especially toward the end). Remember that the result should be fluid enough to form a wave on the dish when served. 
    Once al dente, turn the flame off, mix in the remaining butter, the Parmigiano, parsley, a pinch of pepper and serve.

  preparation: "If the potatoes are young and thin skinned, wash and rub them with a rough cloth. Otherwise, peel them. Trim the tough outer leaves off the artichokes (continue until the exposed leaves are almost all white), cut the tops off (perpendicular to the length of the artichoke) and cut them into eighths, putting the slices into water acidulated with lemon juice to keep them from turning black. When you have finished cutting them up, pat them dry and saut&eacute;	 them in a pan with the oil, garlic, salt, and minced parsley. Begin over a low flame, covered, and after a little while uncover them and turn them often so they cook well on all sides, browning and almost coming apart. When they're done drain away almost all the oil. In the meantime heat the remaining oil in a high-sided pot suitable for frying, and add the potatoes in one fell swoop with a half cup of water. Let them cook gently at first, covering the pot so that they soften, and then raise the flame and uncover them to brown them. Once the potatoes have browned, drain them and add them to the artichokes, together with salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for about ten minutes over a very low flame"

    The sauce is now ready to be used. If fresh tomatoes are not available, canned peeled tomatoes may be used, provided they are of good quality. If the tomatoes are not very ripe, add a small carrot, finely diced, to the soffritto. This will help to tone down the acidity of the unripe tomatoes. \r\n\
    Good tomato sauce is the basic condiment of many a wonderful dish."

  preparation: "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Wash & dry the potatoes. Bake the potatoes until they are fork tender, about 45 minutes. While the potatoes are baking prepare the sauce by cooking the cheese, butter and cream over low heat until the cheese has completely melted into the cream and the sauce has slightly thickened. Set aside. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel and put through a potato ricer. While still warm, place the prepared potatoes on a large board forming a mound with a hole in the centre. add the yolk and the salt into the centre. Slowly start adding the flour a little at a time, mixing well with your hands and continue until you have created a soft workable dough. Knead gently only briefly until you have achieved a smooth, pliable if slightly sticky dough. To shape the gnocchi, first break the dough into fist sized pieces, and roll each piece into a log about the thickness of your thumb. Cut into 1 inch pieces. To finish, take a fork and place it against your work board. With it's back towards you, press each piece of dough with your index finger firmly up the length of the fork tines. Let the gnocchi fall back onto the board and continue with the remaining pieces in this manner. Place the prepared gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet and either cook immediately, or keep refrigerated until ready to use, preferably not more than 3 hours. To cook, drop carefully into salted boiling water and remove immediately as they have all floated to the surface. Drain and top with the gorgonzola sauce. Serve sprinkled with the fresh, chopped parsley and grated parmesan "
