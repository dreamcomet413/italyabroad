  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    Italyabroad.com is the place for <b>Italian wine and food made by small and passionate producers</b>. We are a growing group of passionate people who love what we do; everything started more than 30 years ago when I had my first sip of wine sitting on my granddad knees, he was so proud of his wine that gave a 2 year old nephew a taste. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that some of the <b>best Italian wines and food are made by small, passionate producers</b> who respect the environment because they know that, without it, they will be unemployed. They are <b>family run</b>, the whole family works in the vineyards or fields, pasticceria (bakery) or pastificio (where the pasta is made); they are following the <b>family tradition</b>, they are at the 3rd, 4th or even more, generation, and they know everything there is to know; they are so proud of their wines and food that name them after their son or daughter, granddad or father. <b>These are the people behind our products.</b> 
  </p>
